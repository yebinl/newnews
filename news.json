Breach! Breach!”, before a loud bang and a fire alarm begins to sound.\n\nInside Paddock’s body is seen on his back, clad in dark pants and a long-sleeve shirt with a glove on his left hand. A pool of blood stains the carpet near his head as a police SWAT officer walks past.\n\nOfficers in the videos mentioned the number of firearms scattered around the room, one saying there were at least 10 high-powered weapons.\n\n“Did he have any scoped weapons over there?” an officer asked.\n\nOthers talked about Paddock “blasting out the window” and pointed to “a whole suitcase full of loaded AK mags”, referring to ammunition magazines for an AK-47 rifle.\n\nOfficers are seen looking behind curtains, and one grabbed an assault-style rifle from the ledge of a broken window. An officer told others to watch where they were stepping.\n\n“I don’t know what that is, but there’s a wire there,” the officer said. He then turned toward the room’s door and said, “He put cameras up on the peepholes and all that. That’s what these wires are.”\n\n‘He sent her away’: Sisters of Las Vegas gunman’s Australian girlfriend break their silence A sleepless gambler who berated his girlfriend in Starbucks – chilling details emerge of Vegas gunman Pictured: The Las Vegas gunman behind the ‘worst shooting in US history’ ‘You need to get out’: Aussie man was staying in room next to Las Vegas shooter An officer said the attacker “has an intricate camera system set up … so he knew when officers were coming down the hallway”. The videos also record officers talking about whether there was evidence of a second shooter and finding Paddock’s driver’s license. Police and the FBI later said they believe the 64-year-old former accountant and high-stakes video poker player acted alone. Police say Paddock blasted round after round from the 32nd floor of the Mandelay Hotel into an unsuspecting crowd beneath him. Source: AP The footage does not show what the first officer through the door saw because he did not activate his body-worn camera. The disclosure by police lawyers late on Tuesday raised questions about whether officers followed department policy. A police spokeswoman, Carla Alston, said on Wednesday no one in the agency would comment about the videos, whether the first officer followed proper procedure by not turning on his camera or whether he had been disciplined for violating policies. The department requires officers with body cameras to activate them during calls that lead to interaction with residents and searches. The newly released videos, totalling two-and-a-half hours, are a sample of hundreds of hours of body-camera recordings and do not provide a complete view of everything police discovered when they entered Paddock’s suite.

Source: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department via AP The Associated Press and other media outlets sued to obtain videos, 911 recordings, evidence logs and interview reports to shed light on the response by public agencies, emergency workers and hotel officials while Paddock fired for more than 10 minutes. The police investigation is not finished, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters Tuesday, saying he believed releasing the footage would “further traumatise a wounded community”. “For that, we apologise,” the elected head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. “What is seen on those videos in no way changes the facts that we were able to clarify for you shortly after the crime.” Sheriff Lombardo referred to a preliminary police report released on January 19 that said Paddock meticulously planned the attack, researched police SWAT tactics, rented hotel rooms overlooking outdoor concerts and investigated potential targets in at least four US cities. Police department lawyers had told a judge it would be time-consuming and costly to comply with the media outlets’ public records requests and said the materials could disclose investigative techniques. But the Nevada Supreme Court last week upheld a state judge’s ruling that the records must be made public. Sherriff Lombardo said on Tuesday the department would release more recordings in batches in coming weeks.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-03T22:00:26.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Yahoo.com"},"urlToImage":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pqflF2k0we7VRAEFuNuXFw--~B/aD01NDk7dz05NzY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-03/886c79e0-4f18-11e8-a885-15b8d1b3f6ed_VEGAS_INLINE_2.jpg","digest":"iD3ZBWqHeRux9gNnY2m7EA==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aecb1320a500bdef4332829"},"description":"The indictment Martin Winterkorn makes Volkswagen more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders who say top managers concealed risks.","title":"Ex-Volkswagen CEO Charged With Fraud Over Diesel Emissions","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/business/volkswagen-ceo-diesel-fraud.html","text":"Many in the industry have long said it was implausible that the illegal software could have been installed in millions of diesel models worldwide for nearly a decade without the knowledge of top management — especially at Volkswagen, known for its top-down culture.\n\nThe accusations against Mr. Winterkorn will raise further questions about the thoroughness of Volkswagen’s internal investigation of the wrongdoing. Volkswagen never made the findings public, although it had promised to do so.\n\nAnd the indictments provide ammunition to critics who say Volkswagen continues to rely on managers who held high-ranking positions while the wrongdoing was taking place, and who worked closely with Mr. Winterkorn. They include Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of Volkswagen’s supervisory board and former chief financial officer, and Rupert Stadler, head of the Audi division.\n\n“Volkswagen continues to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals,” the company said in a statement Thursday. “It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.”\n\nThe grand jury indictment was unsealed in Federal District Court in Detroit only hours after Volkswagen’s annual shareholders meeting in Berlin. Many shareholders complained about a lack of accountability at the top.\n\nAmong the speakers was Michael Viehs, associate director of responsibility at Hermes EOS, a firm in London that represents the interests of large investors. In an interview ahead of the meeting, Mr. Viehs referred to surveys showing that even Volkswagen employees are concerned that not enough has been done to create a healthier corporate culture.\n\n“This is a little bit concerning that, three years after the emissions scandal became public, employees say they don’t see that much progress in overhauling the corporate culture,” he said.\n\nHerbert Diess, who was appointed chief executive last month, acknowledged in a speech to shareholders that Volkswagen had a lot of work to do to prevent future scandals.\n\n“Volkswagen has to become more honest, more open, more truthful,” he said. “Every large organization experiences unethical conduct and instances of noncompliance. But to speak plainly: We clearly had too much of that going on until recently.”\n\nMr. Winterkorn, 70, is believed to be in Germany, which does not normally extradite its citizens. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, including in testimony before the German Parliament.\n\n“We are reviewing the allegations and will take appropriate action,” Steven Molo, a lawyer for Mr. Winterkorn in the United States, said in an email.\n\nBut the United States case probably increases the chances that Mr. Winterkorn will face charges in Germany. Prosecutors there are conducting their own wide-ranging investigation, which included a raid on offices of the company’s Porsche division last month.\n\nLast year, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to United States charges that included conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act. But the company blamed lower-level managers for the wrongdoing and maintained that no members of its top management had been involved.\n\nIf it is proven that Mr. Winterkorn was a party to the conspiracy, Volkswagen would be significantly more vulnerable to lawsuits brought by shareholders who accuse top managers of shirking their obligation to inform them of the risks the company was taking. The shareholders are seeking some $10 billion in damages, which would be on top of the roughly $26 billion in fines and civil damages that the carmaker has already paid.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Winterkorn was informed in early 2014 that regulators in the United States were asking why Volkswagen diesel vehicles had produced low emissions during laboratory tests but drastically higher emissions on the road.\n\nThe indictment said Mr. Winterkorn had approved plans to conceal from regulators the true reason for the discrepancies: The cars were equipped with software, known as a defeat device, that could detect when emissions tests were underway.\n\nIf the car was being tested, it deployed equipment to keep emissions within legal limits. At other times, the pollution controls were disabled or only partly deployed to protect components from wear.\n\nMr. Winterkorn continued to endorse efforts to cover up the wrongdoing until shortly before a Volkswagen employee disobeyed orders and revealed the defeat device to California regulators in August 2015, the indictment says.\n\nMr. Winterkorn, known as an unforgiving boss who loudly berated subordinates who failed to meet his standards, was Volkswagen’s chief executive for eight years and an influential executive for two decades. He was a protégé of Ferdinand Piëch, the Porsche family scion who dominated the company for two decades.\n\nMr. Winterkorn joins five other defendants, all former managers who worked in engine development, who were charged last year. They are accused of conspiring to defraud the United States government in its enforcement of pollution standards under the Clean Air Act, and conspiring to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act itself.\n\nIn pleading guilty to felony charges last year, Volkswagen admitted that it had illegally sold nearly 600,000 vehicles equipped with defeat devices. It paid $4.3 billion in penalties and was put on probation for three years, with a former federal prosecutor, Larry D. Thompson, overseeing its compliance with ethics and regulatory measures.\n\nA former Volkswagen manager in Michigan, Oliver Schmidt, was sentenced in December to seven years in prison for his role in the scheme. A former Volkswagen engineer who worked in California, James Liang, was sentenced last year to three and a half years in prison.\n\nIn addition, United States authorities are seeking extradition of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, 61, a former Audi manager who is in Germany. As an Italian citizen, Mr. Pamio does not enjoy the same immunity from extradition that the German defendants do.\n\nGerman prosecutors have made no formal charges but are expected to do so by the end of the year. Two suspects are in custody after judges determined there was a risk they might flee or obstruct the investigation. More than 50 people are suspected of wrongdoing, according to German authorities.","author":"Jack Ewing","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-03T21:56:15.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/business/04vw1/merlin_100445308_973e2592-96cf-4557-ad81-55123fe765fb-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"XjyeOoUakWu9tychgSOBlA==\n"}

He'd previously said he had no knowledge of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who alleges she had sex with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the encounter.\n\nInstead, Trump sought to underscore his own religious bonafides, including his insistence that he'd revived the use of the term \"one nation under God.\"\n\n\"They're starting to say it more, just like we're starting to say 'Merry Christmas' when that day comes around,\" he said as a crowd of faith leaders watched on. \"You notice a big difference between now and two or three years ago?\" Though the event began with a performance by a gospel choir and prayers recited by six leaders from different faiths, Trump only arrived to deliver his remarks at the end. As the prayers proceeded, he was seen through a window sitting inside the Oval Office a few paces away, speaking with his chief of staff John Kelly. After his speech and signing ceremony, Trump lingered for a moment to speak with some of the guests as a reporter shouted: \"Why are you changing your story on Stormy Daniels?\" One of the guests shouted back, \"shame on you.\" A fact-sheet circulated by the White House said the new initiative will focus on four areas: providing recommendations on how the administration's policies affect faith-based and community groups, finding ways to cooperate with faith-based and community groups to fight poverty, apprising the administration of any \"failures\" in the Trump administration to protect religious liberty; and reducing \"burdens on the free-exercise of religion.\" Under Presidents George W. Bush, who created the first White House faith-based office, and Barack Obama, who continued the office, the administration focused less on religious freedom concerns and more on partnering with local faith and community groups. The shift to a greater emphasis on religious freedom could be seen as a way of keeping the Trump administration's priorities in line with his white evangelical base, who, under past administrations, have seen the federal government more as a threat than a potential partner. \"It is written to ensure that people of all faiths will have equal access,\" said Johnnie Moore, a de facto spokesman for a group of evangelicals who regularly meet with and advise Trump. \"People in the Trump administration really do have a conviction that private charities, churches and other faith-based groups do really effective work and we ought to be doing everything in our power to reduce the barrier to entry so they can participate in government programs,\" Moore said. It is unclear who will head the initiative, which will report to the Office of Public Liaison, according to the executive order, or how it will be funded. Moore said the administration has been discussing the executive order for seven months, and denied speculation that it was hastily added to the schedule for National Prayer Day to deflect from the porn star payment controversy.","author":"Kevin Liptak and Daniel Burke, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-03T19:54:18.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180307113630-01-donald-trump-stormy-daniels-split-super-tease.jpg","digest":"UG0/FrgrtRZvbzRIj0tYMQ==\n"}

As a state lawmaker, he bought a house with a lobbyist but did not disclose it.","title":"Pruitt's Coziness With Lobbyists Includes Secretly Buying a House With One","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/scott-pruitt-lobbyist-house.html","text":"The home in Oklahoma City was registered to a shell company owned by Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Whitefield and four other associates. The New York Times reported last month that the house was bought at a steep discount from a lobbyist, Marsha Lindsey, who worked for a telecommunications company with business before the Oklahoma state legislature.\n\nMr. Pruitt’s business relationship with Mr. Whitefield has not been previously reported. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said that Mr. Whitefield held a one-sixth stake in the company and had “received taxable income” from it. Two of the other owners, The Times previously reported, were Kenneth Wagner, a law school friend of Mr. Pruitt’s who now holds a top political job at the E.P.A., and Jon Jiles, a health care executive who contributed to Mr. Pruitt’s political campaigns.\n\n“Whitefield was a practicing lawyer who had business in Oklahoma City,” said the spokesman, Jahan Wilcox. “Pruitt was a practicing lawyer and a part-time legislator who only stayed in the house when he was in Oklahoma City for business.”\n\nMr. Whitefield died in a plane crash in 2006. A relative confirmed to the The Times that he had shared the home with Mr. Pruitt.\n\nMr. Pruitt is now facing 11 federal investigations into matters including his condominium rental in Washington and his spending on travel and security at the E.P.A. The Times reported on Tuesday that Mr. Pruitt had allowed another lobbyist friend to play an unusually central role in arranging his agenda during a visit to Morocco in December. Just months after the trip, the Moroccan government hired the lobbyist, Richard Smotkin, as a $40,000-a-month foreign agent.\n\nMr. Pruitt, Mr. Whitefield and the other investors in the shell company bought the Oklahoma City home in December 2003 for $375,000, a discount of about $100,000 from what Ms. Lindsey had paid a year earlier. Her employer, the telecom giant SBC Oklahoma, now AT\u0026T and formerly known as Southwestern Bell, used a relocation firm to handle the sale and picked up the shortfall under her retirement package. AT\u0026T said the home had been appraised twice, for an average value of $390,000, before the sale.\n\nA month later, in January 2004, Mr. Pruitt held a news conference at the State Capitol to announce a bill that he said would reduce workers’ compensation costs for businesses by eliminating unnecessary litigation.\n\nIn a news release, he cited figures from the National Council on Compensation Insurance, a workers’ compensation industry group, which said his proposal would save employers in Oklahoma at least $100 million. At the time, Mr. Whitefield was a lobbyist for the group, according to state disclosures.\n\nMr. Whitefield later became a registered lobbyist for Oklahomans for Workers’ Compensation Reform, a political committee co-chaired by Mr. Funk, the businessman who owned the minor league baseball team with Mr. Pruitt and several others.\n\nMr. Funk attended the news conference in January 2004, and a February 2005 update from the political committee, co-written by Mr. Funk, noted Mr. Pruitt’s work on legislation that would cut “litigation and the expensive cost drivers that are present in our lawyer-rich system.”\n\nThe workers’ compensation battle played out for years in Oklahoma, and news reports at the time referred to Mr. Pruitt as a leading Republican in dealing with Democrats and the governor’s office on the issue. Ultimately, after a partisan struggle, a compromise bill was signed into law in June 2005, with Mr. Pruitt as a main negotiator.\n\nMr. Pruitt described the outcome as “a small step in the right direction,” according to a report at the time in The Journal Record, a business and legal newspaper in Oklahoma. But when he ran for lieutenant governor in 2006, he cited his efforts on workers’ compensation among his main achievements. Mr. Funk served as the chairman of that unsuccessful campaign.\n\nWhen Mr. Pruitt left the State Senate that year, his fellow lawmakers applauded his advocacy on workers’ compensation. In his parting remarks, Mr. Pruitt told colleagues: “I’ve always tried to approach what we do here in this body with a commitment to sound policy and trying to do things for the right reason. I believe that good politics is doing the right thing.”\n\nMr. Pruitt and the other investors in the shell company — Capitol House L.L.C. — sold the Oklahoma City house in 2005 for $470,000. It is unclear whether any of the proceeds went to Mr. Pruitt. The group also had at least one paying tenant, Jim Dunlap, then a Republican leader in the State Senate, who said he rented a room above the garage.\n\nMr. Jiles, the investor who is listed as manager of Capitol House, said in an email that each investor owned 16.66 percent of the company, and while none of them lived permanently in the house, they all had a right to stay there. The company, he said, should not be referred to as a shell company since it “acquired assets consisting of the house and its furnishings and incurred liabilities, filed tax returns and issued K-1’s to it’s members as required by law” — a reference to the tax form known as a Schedule K-1.\n\n“Nothing about the transaction, Capital House, L.L.C. or the investment was unusual, inappropriate, illegal or otherwise objectionable to anyone involved on either side of the transaction,” Mr. Jiles said, using another spelling for the company.\n\nAt a hearing last week in Washington of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers asked Mr. Pruitt about the house purchase and the use of a shell company — a lawful practice that is often used to obscure the people who have a financial interest in it, and typically is set up as a limited liability company. Mr. Pruitt’s name does not appear on any public documents related to the company; nor does Mr. Whitefield’s.\n\n\n\nMr. Pruitt said the company was not a shell company, but a limited liability company.\n\n“Which is normally how you buy real estate in Oklahoma,” he said.","author":"http://www.nytimes.com/by/hiroko-tabuchi, http://www.nytimes.com/by/steve-eder","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-03T16:44:54.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/us/04reg-pruitt1/03reg-pruitt1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"1BDT3w56y5MUV43uRz31rw==\n"}

The eruption is not over, as there continues to be volcanic activity in the area, they stressed.\n\n“At this point it is wait and see what happens next,” said Janet Babb, HVO geologist.\n\nHawaii Electric Light employees are going to the Leilani Estates area tonight to disconnect power in the places impacted by the active lava flow.\n\nUtility personnel are on scene. Although the areas near Mohala Street are without power, crews are doing work to reroute power to maintain electric service for the rest of Leilani Estates that is not impacted by the lava.\n\nThe company expects to have sufficient generation for tonight, despite the emergency shutdown of independent power producer Puna Geothermal Venture. A generation shortfall is not expected.\n\nGov. David Ige signed an emergency proclamation tonight that “authorizes the expenditure of state monies as appropriated for quick and efficient relief caused by the volcanic eruption.”\n\nThe proclamation comes about three hours after a Kilauea volcano lava outbreak inundated a neighborhood in the eastern end of the Leilani Estates residential subdivisionin lower Puna on the Big Island.\n\n“The lava is flowing onto streets in the subdivision, which consists of about 770 structures,” the governor announced. The lava flow prompted the mandatory evacuation of about 1,700 residents of Leilani Estates.\n\n“The danger is of such magnitude that it warrants preemptive and protective action in order to provide for the safety, health and welfare of the residents of Leilani Estates and surrounding areas,” the governor office said.\n\nGov. David Ige has called in the Hawaii National Guard to help with evacuation efforts in lower Puna as a new Kilauea volcano lava outbreak inundates a Leilani Estates neighborhood.\n\n“I am in contact with Mayor (Harry) Kim, and the state is actively supporting the county’s emergency response efforts,” the governor said in a news release tonight. “I have activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide support to county emergency response personnel to help with evacuations and security. I urge residents in Leilani Estates and the surrounding areas to follow instructions from the county of Hawaii’s Civil Defense Agency. Please be alert and prepare now to keep your family safe.”\n\nA Hawaii National Guard spokesman told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that additional soldiers will be called up Friday, however he did not have a specific number.\n\nActing Hawaii County Mayor Wil Okabe issued a state of emergency declaration earlier this evening. The state of emergency is in effect for the next 60 days or until further action by the county.\n\nThe American Red Cross has opened a second shelter for lower Puna residents evacuated after a lava flow emerged in a Leilani Estates neighborhood.\n\nThe second shelter is at the Keaau Community Center on 16-186 Pili Mua St. The Red Cross earlier opened a shelter at Pahoa Community Center.\n\nHawaii County police say access to Leilani Estates and Lani Puna subdivisions in lower Puna is now closed due to steam and lava emissions from a crack in the area of Mohala Street, with access granted to residents only.\n\nRoad closures are in effect at Highway 130 and Leilani Boulevard, Highway 132 and Pohoiki Road, and Highway 137 and Pohoiki Road.\n\n“We are asking that all motorists stay clear of these areas to assist first responders in evacuation efforts. Stay tuned to local news and radio to be informed of updates and any conditions that may affect your safety,” police said.\n\nWitness Michael Hale told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that after seeing the explosions of lava bursting from the long, fiery fissure just two blocks from his home and business, he found his sense of what’s important dramatically clarified.\n\n“I looked around and asked myself ‘what’s valuable?’” Hale said, recalling the tense moments before he evacuated Hale Hale Hostel and Vacation Rentals. “In that moment, nothing looked valuable. I filled the (truck) cab with mostly junk and that was it.”\n\nJust an hour earlier, Hale had heard the first rumblings from a violent breach of steam and lava escaping through a rift along Mohala Street in the Leilani Estates subdivision in Pahoa.\n\n“I could see the plumes from my roof,” he said.\n\nIn short order, County Civil Defense ordered an evacuation of the eastern end of the subdivision, from Luana Street to Mohala Street.\n\nHale ran to one of his nearby rental units to inform his tenants before evacuating to the northern end of the subdivision to await further instructions. Within another hour, Civil Defense extended the evacuation to the entire subdivision.\n\nMany of the evacuees took shelter at Pahoa Regional Community Center.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists said that shortly before 5 p.m., lava was confirmed at the surface in the eastern end of the Leilani Estates subdivision.\n\nThey said that new ground cracks were reported in Leilani Estates late this afternoon, with white, hot vapor and blue fumes coming from craxks in the eastern end of the subdivision.\n\nAreas downslope of the erupting vent are at risk of lava inundation, an HVO alert said with the Leilani subdivision appears at greatest risk.\n\n“The opening phases of fissure eruptions are dynamic. Additional vents and new lava outbreaks may occur and at this time it is not possible to say where new vents may occur,” HVO scientists said.\n\n\u003e\u003e For more Facebook video on your mobile app, visit https://www.facebook.com/maija.stenback/videos/10215157639749910/\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense has extended the mandatory evacuation to all residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions.\n\nLower Puna resident Ikaika Marzo said at 5:30 p.m. that lava fountains were shooting up 150 feet in the air, with molten lava spreading out over an area 200 yards wide behind a house on Mohala Street in Leilani Estates.\n\n“It sounds like a jet engine. It’s going hard,” he said.\n\nMarzo, who runs a concession in Kalapana, was urging followers on social media to come to Leilani Estates to help people evacuate.\n\n“There are a lot of elderly people who need help to get their stuff out,” Marzo said.\n\nCounty officials caution that the intersection at Highway 132 and Pohoiki Road is closed to allow evacuation efforts to proceed.\n\nLeilani Estates has a population of about 1,500, according to the 2010 U.S. Census.\n\nDrone video courtesy of Jeremiah Osuna shows a stream of lava crossing a wooded area and a roadway.

The evacuation area stretches from Luana Street to Pohoiki Road, said Kanani Aton of Civil Defense.\n\nAmerican Red Cross officials said they are opening a shelter at the Pahoa Community Center on Kuahale Street for residents evacuated from their homes due to the lava threat.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense officials say the agency is on “high alert on a 24-hour basis for the possibility of a volcanic eruption in the lower Puna area.”\n\nThe entire county emergency response team has been activated, officials said.\n\nThey also issued a new map of the high-risk areas, which run from Puu Oo crater down to Kapoho, including Leilani Estates and Kaohe Homesteads.\n\n“All areas bordering the east rift zone are at high risk for eruption activities,” said a Hawaii County news released late this afternoon. “Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has identified magma movement in the lower east rift zone. We urge all residents to keep themselves informed and on the alert.”\n\nCounty officials said that residents should be on the alert for lava inundation, fire, smoke, methane gas explosion, earthquakes, poor air quality.\n\nResidents in the high-risk areas are urged to:\n\n\u003e\u003e Stay informed by listening to the radio.\n\n\u003e\u003e Report any unusual events to Civil Defense at 935-0031.\n\nEvacuation shelters will be open as needed, they said\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey has upgraded the size of the 10:30 a.m. earthquake on Kilauea volcano to 5.0 magnitude. USGS had initially listed the quake as magnitude 4.2, then 4.7.\n\nThe quake was centered about 18 miles south-southwest of Hawaiian Paradise Park and 26.6 miles south of Hilo, at a depth of about 4 miles. It is the strongest tremor so far in a series of hundreds of magnitude 2.5 quakes or greater in the east rift zone of the volcano. Scientists say the quakes and increased magma activity are a sign that a lava outbreak is possible. Residents of lower Puna have been warned to be ready to evacuate and to monitor county and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reports on the developing situation.\n\nThe USGS “Did you feel it?” website received more than 500 reports from residents throughout Hawaii island.\n\n“It appears that ground shaking from the earthquake caused rockfalls in the Puu Oo crater on Kilauea Volcano’s East Rift Zone, which resulted in a short-lived plume of reddish ash rising above the cone,” said Tina Neal, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientist-in-charge.\n\nThe quake was too small to generate a tsunami.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists reported that the 10:30 a.m. quake south of Puu Oo caused rockfalls and a possible additional collapse into the crater on Kilauea volcano.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 4.7, the largest so far in hundreds of small tremors in the area in recent days. Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists said ground shaking from the quake south of Puu Oo on the lower east rift zone led to a short-lived plume of ash from the collapse. The plume lofted skyward and is dissipating as it drifts southwest. “Anyone downwind may experience a dusting of ash,” an HVO report said.\n\nThe earthquake caused no other changes at Kilauea Volcano, scientists said.\n\nHawaii County police said they have reopened Pohoiki Road between Highway 132 and Leilani Avenue, which had been closed due to the emergence of cracks in the roadway. The cracks are believed to have been caused by the seismic activity and magma movement in the lower east rift zone of Kilauea volcano. Police said a metal plate was placed over the damaged pavement.\n\nA magnitude 4.6 magnitude earthquake struck the south flank of Kilauea Volcano at about 10:30 a.m. today, Hawaii County Civil Defense reported.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the tremor was not large enough to cause a tsunami.\n\nThe latest quake is the largest in hundreds of magnitude 2.5 and larger tremors over the last few days which scientists say is a possible precursor of a new lava outbreak from Kilauea volcano’s lower east rift zone.\n\nEarlier today, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory reported that there had been a slight drop in intensity of magma intrusion in the area along the east rift zone.The intrusion is not migrating further to the east, according to spokeswoman Janet Babb.\n\n“There has been some decrease in the seismic deformation but it’s still active,” she said.\n\nScientists have indicated an eruption is possible but not imminent.

Giuliani sought Friday to clean up a series of comments made during a whirlwind media tour meant to bolster the president’s standing regarding a payment to a porn star but that instead created new problems for his client.\n\nIn a statement issued hours after Trump told reporters Giuliani was still getting up to speed on the facts, the former New York mayor said that a $130,000 payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels by longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen would have happened regardless of whether Trump was on the presidential ballot the following month.\n\n“The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President’s family,” Giuliani said in the statement. “It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Giuliani revealed that the president had reimbursed Cohen for the settlement Cohen paid in October 2016 to keep Daniels from disclosing details of a sexual encounter she alleged she had with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nGiuliani has said that the details of the reimbursement showed that Trump paid back Cohen because it was a personal, not a campaign expense. But campaign finance law experts said Giuliani’s remarks did not rule out violations of campaign finance laws, and some of his statements may have actually provided new evidence for investigators.\n\nAppearing Thursday on the Fox News Channel, for instance, Giuliani asked viewers to imagine if Daniels had aired her allegations “on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.”\n\n“Cohen didn’t even ask,” Giuliani told viewers. “Cohen made it go away. He did his job.”\n\nIn his statement, Giuliani also sought to make clear that he speaking in television interviews about his understanding of events in which Trump had been involved and not about what the president knew at the time. The distinction is important because if Giuliani publicly described a private conversation with the president, he might have inadvertently waived attorney-client privilege on that conversation, potentially opening the door for prosecutors to probe further into what was said.\n\nOne close Trump adviser said Giuliani had “waived the privilege big time” with his appearance on “Fox \u0026 Friends” and description of his conversations with his client, the president.\n\nThis adviser, who requested anonymnity to speak more candidly, said Giuliani’s misstatement came because he relied on Trump’s description of what happened, without independently researching the nature of the payments.\n\n“Rudy followed the client’s wishes without knowing all the facts,” the person said.\n\nGiuliani also stated that it was “undisputed” that Trump had the constitutional power to fire former FBI director James B. Comey, which he did last year. Trump’s action is among those under scrutiny by special counsel Robert S. Muller III as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n“Recent revelations about former Director Comey further confirm the wisdom of the President’s decision, which was plainly in the best interests of our nation,” Giuliani said.\n\nIn saying that Trump had the power to Comey, Giuliani appeared to be backing away from an assertion he made earlier this week that the president acted out of frustration that Comey wouldn’t publicly state that the president was not under investigation by the FBI.\n\nThat earlier statement raised concerns among some legal experts who said Giuliani seemed to say Comey was fired over the Russia investigation – and such an admission could further an obstruction of justice probe involving the president.\n\nCohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for possible bank fraud, wire fraud, and campaign finance violations, according to people familiar with the matter. FBI agents searched Cohen’s house, office, and hotel room.\n\nIn early April, after Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he was unaware of the settlement that Cohen had paid to Daniels.\n\nSince Giuliani began discussing these matters publicly two days ago, the White House has been besieged with questions about their past denials of the president’s knowledge, and on Friday morning, Trump suggested Giuliani had misspoken.\n\n“Rudy is a great guy, but he just started a day ago, but he really has his heart into it, he’s working hard, he’s learning the subject matter,” Trump told reporters as he prepared to leave the White House.\n\n“He knows it’s a witch hunt,” Trump continued. “He’ll get his facts straight.”\n\nTrump talked to reporters again Friday after taking a helicopter from the White House to Joint Base Andrews and before departing to Dallas, where he is addressing a gathering of the National Rifle Association Friday afternoon.\n\n“Rudy’s great,” Trump said there. adding: “He wasn’t totally familiar with everything.”\n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump issued a trio of carefully worded tweets, largely echoing the points Giuliani had made in his Wednesday night interview.\n\nIn a brief telephone interview later Friday, Giuliani said the episode has not hurt his standing with Trump.\n\n“He says he loves me,” Giuliani said, calling the issue a matter of “interpretation.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump saw Giuliani as a loyal surrogate – and the two men even watched sports together riding back from events.\n\nBut Giuliani and Trump have never been close friends, associates say, and Giuliani was upset by his treatment during the transition – when he was passed over for secretary of state by Trump’s eventual choice of businessman Rex Tillerson.\n\nOver recent months, Giuliani has occasionally spoken to the president but has not been in his coterie of close advisers.\n\nTrump also said Friday that if he could be treated fairly he would “love to speak” to federal prosecutors investigating ties between his campaign and Russia. He said he would do so even over the objections of his lawyers — if he could be convinced the Russia probe is not a “witch hunt.”\n\n“I would love to speak. I would love to go,” Trump said. “Nothing I want to do more, because we did nothing wrong.”\n\nBut, he added, “I have to find that we’re going to be treated fairly. ... Right now, it’s a pure witch hunt.”\n\nThose comments come as Trump’s lawyers are continuing to negotiate with special Muller about the conditions of a possible interview.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have said in recent days that they fear Mueller is trying to trap Trump into committing perjury during an extended interview. Mueller has suggested Trump could be subpoenaed if he doesn’t voluntarily talk.\n\nTrump also complained that there are too many “angry Democrats” on Mueller’s team. He did not mention that Mueller himself is a Republican.\n\n“Why aren’t we having Republican people doing what these Democratic people are doing?” Trump asked.\n\nSenior White House staffer were caught off guard Wednesday by Giuliani's first appearance on Fox News when he disclosed that Trump had repaid Daniels. White House press secretary told reporters on Thursday that she had not learned about the repayment until seeing Giuliani on television that night.\n\nOn Friday, a person close to the White House said Giuliani was still not consulting with White House counsel Donald McGahn nor Emmet Flood, the White House attorney recently hired to handle the Russia investigation.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity to speak more candidly, said it is possible that Giuliani had a strategy in mind but that it wasn’t clear.\n\nOn Friday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who ran President Trump’s campaign in its closing months, said that she was not aware at the time that Cohen made the $130,000 payment.\n\n“I had never heard about that during the campaign,” Conway told reporters at the White House. “I was the campaign manager. A lot crossed my desk.”\n\nCarol D. Leonnig and Rosalind S.

He was taken by a police car to Stroger Hospital, where ATF officials said he was stable and expected to make a full recovery.\n\nOfficials said the agent, in his late 20s, was shot during an investigation of illegal guns but gave no details. No one was in custody.\n\nRadio traffic shows officers with the agent initially planned to take him to a fire station about four blocks away, but then decided to drive the agent to the hospital, calling repeatedly for escorts to clear the way.\n\n“We need an escort … we’re going to the fire station,” one officer radios.\n\n\"We got shots fired by police,” another officer says. “We have an ATF agent shot. He's the one going to the fire station right now.”\n\nBut the officers changed their mind and decided to head to Stroger. “I need an escort to a (expletive) hospital right now,” an officer says.“Officer hit. We need an escort to a hospital now.”\n\n“He may be hit in the head,” an officer radios seconds later. “We need escort for CPD car. … We’re going to Stroger.”\n\nNeighbors close to the shooting said they lost count of the number of shots fired.\n\nLuz Campos, who lives several houses down from the shooting, was in her kitchen tending to a toddler when she heard someone say, “Open the door. Open the door.”\n\nShe then heard what she thought were fireworks. “Then the cops were coming.”\n\nCampos stepped outside with the young boy and saw a rush of police cars. The boy stood behind her and waved to an officer who was walking toward the shooting scene. The officer waved back.\n\nOther neighbors said they heard a barrage of gunshots. One woman, who was asleep on a couch in her front room, said she awoke to continued gunfire. “We just heard a lot of shots.”\n\nBy sunrise, groups of ATF agents and Chicago police officers — at least two of them high-ranking department officials — walked up and down 44th Street near the shooting. Gusts of wind shook yellow crime tape as children with backpacks headed to school.\n\nThe wounded agent is part of a strike force formed last June to cut the flow of illegal guns into Chicago and crack down on people repeatedly arrested on gun charges, officials said. Twenty ATF agents were assigned to the task force, along with 20 officers from the Police Department and the Illinois State Police.\n\nIn Back of the Yards, the ATF agents have teamed with Chicago police to investigate gang-related rifle shootings that have become more common in that area over the last two years. The Tribune has reported that more than 140 people have been shot — 50 of them fatally — from the fall of 2016 to the end of 2017 by gang members wielding rifles as their use spread across the South and Southwest sides.\n\nThe agent is the fourth law enforcement officer to be shot in Back of the Yards in the last year.\n\nOn May 2, 2017, two Deering District officers were riding in a covert van when they were wounded by rifle fire. One suspect was arrested and a second remains at large. A few weeks later, another Chicago police officer was shot at 43rd Street and Ashland Avenue.","author":"Madeline Buckley, Jeremy Gorner","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T18:20:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Chicagotribune.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-5aeca55c/turbine/ct-met-atf-agent-shot-20180504","digest":"avIG7AMEP7KuVrfwfMslXQ==\n"}

(CBS4) – Officials at Colorado State University are in damage control mode after two Native American brothers had “unwelcoming and concerning experience” on a campus tour. The story has drawn national attention.\n\nThe university is offering to reimburse Thomas Gray and his younger brother for the expenses they incurred traveling from their home in New Mexico to Fort Collins for Monday’s tour. They’d also like to bring them back for an all-expenses paid VIP tour.\n\nThe teens didn’t get a chance to experience a complete tour of the university because campus police stopped them for questioning during it.\n\nIt turns out a parent of a different student on the tour contacted police because she thought something didn’t seem right with the two, who were extremely quiet.\n\nOn Friday the university released a new statement about the matter on Twitter, saying they have tried to reach out to the family after the admittedly “unwelcoming and concerning experience.”\n\nThe Twitter statement is as follows:\n\nEarly this week, University officials reached out directly to the family of the young men \u0026 their high school. We’d like the opportunity to speak w/Ms. Gray \u0026 her sons but we have not heard back from the family. We ask them to please get in touch with us at their convenience. We will refund any expenses they incurred traveling to CSU. We deeply regret the unwelcoming and concerning experience they had while guests on our campus. The Office of Admissions, Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Native American Cultural Center, and CSU Police Department all are reviewing how such an incident can be avoided or handled differently in the future.\n\nA few minutes later they tweeted:\n\nCSU welcomes the Gray family to our campus for a VIP tour with all expenses covered.\n\nGray is a freshman at Northern New Mexico College but had considered transferring to CSU. His mother said in an interview that he and his younger brother had planned the campus visit as a bonding experience and that she was disturbed to learn that police had stopped them.\n\n“I got a frantic phone call from Thomas saying ‘somebody called the police on us because we were quiet,’” Lorriane Gray said. “And I couldn’t believe it. I thought he’s just messing with me.”\n\nShe said her boys were too shy to speak up during introductions on the tour.\n\nIn an email to students and staff on Wednesday, university officials outlined what happened next:\n\nPolice responded to the call by contacting the young men, who are Native American and visiting from New Mexico, during the tour. The CSUPD spoke with the students, confirmed they were part of the tour, and allowed them to rejoin the group. Unfortunately, due to the location of the tour when the contact was made, the Admissions tour guide was unaware that police had been called or responded, and the tour group had moved on without the students, who returned to Ammons Hall briefly, then left campus to return home to New Mexico.\n\nLorriane Gray shared the news of what had happened on social media.\n\n“You keep quiet about things they’re going to continue to happen. And it’s our responsibility to speak out and let other people know what’s happening,” she said.\n\n“And in the process, since this went viral in the last couple of days, even other universities have reached out to us and said ‘You know what, we’re looking at our policies now about campus tours and bias and things like that, so it’s already making a difference.”\n\nColorado Lt. Gov.

The vice president's physician later wrote in a memo of feeling intimidated by an irate Jackson during a confrontation over the physician's concerns. The physician informed White House officials of being treated unprofessionally, describing a pattern of behavior from Jackson that made the physician \"uncomfortable\" and even consider resigning from the position. Farah, press secretary for the vice president, said Pence's physician \"brought the issue to Mr. Ayers, who appropriately referred the matter to the proper channels.\" Current and former coworkers accused Jackson of abusive behavior and professional misconduct in interviews with Democratic staff on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which sources briefed on the matter say has investigated those episodes as well as the one involving Karen Pence.

I’m still hurting. When you’re reaching out to my child, that is my child,” Shanara Mobley said in court Thursday. “I am your mother, Kamiyah! I am your mother.”\n\nGloria Williams, the woman who kidnapped Kamiyah in 1998 and raised the girl as her own for 18 years, pleaded guilty in February to kidnapping and interference with custody. Kamiyah is now 19.\n\nShe struck a plea deal on the day her trial was set to begin, which calls for her to serve between zero and 22 years.\n\nOn Thursday, Mobley described how in 1998, hours after giving birth to her daughter, Williams posed as a nurse and said she had to take the baby to have her temperature taken. Mobley was 16 at the time and said she trusted Williams because the woman had spent hours getting to know the mother and child before the kidnapping.\n\nWhen she realized her baby had been kidnapped, Mobley said that she went into a panic.\n\n“I’m screaming and I’m hollering and cussing,” she testified, adding that she began to have suicidal thoughts afterward.\n\n“I always thought about my baby every day, every day, every day,” Mobley said. “I would catch myself in my car crying, in bed crying, taking a bath crying, doing something with her siblings and crying.”\n\nShe saw no sign of Kamiyah for years. Williams raised her and renamed her Alexis Kelli Manigo.\n\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

She was arrested on Jan. 10, 2017, at her home in Walterboro, South Carolina.\n\nWhen first interviewed by police, Kamiyah refused to believe the woman she thought was her mother had kidnapped her. In later interviews, she acknowledged that she had been abducted.\n\nProsecutors previously released letters that Kamiyah and Williams exchanged with each other since Williams’ arrest. The letters provide intimate insight into their relationship.\n\n“I just want everything to go back to normal,” Mobley wrote to Williams in one letter. “I want you home, I need you home.”\n\n“I love you no matter what,” Kamiyah wrote to Williams. “There is nothing or no one who can change that.”","author":"Harriet Sokmensuer","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T17:33:47.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"People.com"},"urlToImage":"https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shanara-mobley.jpg?crop=0px%2C997px%2C1800px%2C946px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"Mtw4wnFOza3xZXFy2MJ6bA==\n"}

(Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTwo days of inconclusive U.S.-China talks ended here Friday amid signs that the Trump administration is demanding dramatic concessions that challenge core elements of China’s economic system and its ambitions for future development.\n\nChina said “big differences” remained as a high-level U.S. government delegation headed home, although consensus had been reached on some issues.\n\nGiven China’s equally uncompromising stance, it was unclear where the two sides had found common ground. U.S. envoys are likely to have met stiff resistance, given their demands for fundamental revisions in how the Chinese leadership manages foreign trade and its domestic economy. The demands included a $200 billion cut in the U.S. trade deficit with China by 2020.\n\nChinese negotiators presented their own hard-line terms for a reshaped trade relationship, demanding the U.S. drop a complaint over China’s licensing terms for foreign patent holders and immediately designate China a market economy, which would give it easier treatment under routine U.S. trade enforcement actions.\n\nThe dueling negotiating menus represented “maximalist” positions that may have made eventual agreement more difficult, said Scott Kennedy, who directs a project on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“This could be remembered as the day that the U.S. and China found out it wasn’t misunderstandings causing their difficulties, ” Kennedy said. “The trouble now may be that they understand each other all too well.”\n\nWith the U.S. team, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, en route to Washington, the White House released a statement calling the talks “frank.”\n\nThe U.S. briefing paper, which was presented to Chinese officials before the talks, said that “the United States-China trade relationship is significantly unbalanced” and “immediate” action is needed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.,The paper appeared on the social media site Weibo before being deleted by Chinese government censors.\n\nThe meetingsmarked an attempt by the Trump administration to leverage changes from China without sparking a potentially disastrous trade war, after threatening to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nU.S. negotiators entered the talks with a sweeping set of demands that called for China to drop its tariffs to match lower U.S. levels; eliminate limits on U.S. investment in key industries; end state-sponsored cyberattacks on U.S. targets; strengthen intellectual property safeguards and halt subsidies for several advanced technology industries.\n\n“Each side has staked out positions the other side will not reach,” said John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “The gap’s pretty wide right now.”\n\nThe talks ended with no details on next steps. But some analysts predicted tough bargaining in the weeks to come.\n\n“The Trump Administration is making very strong demands upfront which is likely to offend the Chinese,” said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong. “It may take them some time to formulate an answer, as they don’t react well to ‘in your face’ demands, particularly from the U.S.”\n\nU.S. negotiators will brief President Trump upon their return. He faces several critical decisions in coming weeks, including whether or not to impose threatened tariffs on Chinese goods even as he seeks Beijing’s help in resolving a simmering showdown over the North Korean nuclear program.\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he expects to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, a Chinese ally, “very soon.”\n\nAfter years of ineffectvie U.S. complaints about Chinese trade practices, Trump clearly has opted to try a tougher line, said Claire Reade, a former U.S. trade negotiator. “The problem is China is not playing by the rules in a very important way and China is way too big to just let it go,” she said.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to give ground on subsidies for key technology industries, which can be difficult to measure and which involve China’s ambitions to match the world’s most advanced economies, Collier said.\n\nThe United States wants China to take swift action to reduce the $375 billion deficit in goods trade by $200 billion by the end of 2020. Washington also is seeking fundamental changes to the way China’s Communist Party runs its economy, taking aim at a massive state-subsidized effort to achieve global dominance in advanced technologies, known as “Made in China 2025.”\n\nChinese experts say Beijing is determined not to give any ground over that issue.\n\n“Asking China to stop its state industrial policy is, to some degree, a violation of China's sovereignty, and it's impossible for China to accept it,” said Lu Xiang, an expert in Sino-U. S. relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.\n\nXinhua reported that two sides agreed to establish a “working mechanism” to maintain close communication on the issues discussed in the talks.\n\n[Opinion: Has the trade war started yet?]\n\nIt also demanded that China strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights and take “immediate, verifiable” steps to halt some of the practices identified in U.S. allegations against the Chinese: notably commercial cyberespionage and the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets.\n\nIt also asked China to ensure that U.S. investors in China are “afforded fair, effective and nondiscriminatory market access and treatment,” and that China reduce “tariffs on all products in noncritical sectors to levels that are no higher than the levels of the United States’ corresponding tariffs.”\n\nWei Jianguo, a former vice commerce minister, said it was beyond the Chinese government's reach to engineer such a rapid rise in imports and reduction in the deficit, since those are commercial decisions largely decided by market forces.\n\n“The U.S. side might not understand the Chinese government and think it has unlimited power to make any decision. It's not like that,” he said.\n\nYu Miaojie, professor at Beijing University’s National School of Development, said the document showed a lack of sincerity from the U.S. side and placed demands that were outside the Chinese government’s “acceptable range.”\n\nU.S. sanctions against leading Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE have also cast a significant shadow over the trade relationship.\n\nLast month, the Commerce Department barred U.S. companies from exporting to ZTE for seven years, saying the company has violated a previous settlement of criminal and civil charges for making shipments to Iran and North Korea.\n\nThat move was a big blow to ZTE, which has relied on U.S. chips and software to power its smartphones. But it has also reinforced China’s determination to accelerate the development of its own high-tech industries and reduce reliance on the United States.\n\n“There's no space for negotiation on China's development,” said Ruan Zongze, executive vice president at Beijing's China Institute of International Studies, a think tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. “China has to progress, and it's unstoppable by anyone.”\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said it made “solemn representations” to the U.S. delegation over the ZTE case during the talks.\n\nLynch reported from Washington. Luna Lin, Lui Yang and Shirley Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\nNothing is certain about Trump’s trade policy other than the uncertainty\n\nU.S. companies banned from selling to China’s ZTE telecom maker\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"https://www.facebook.com/simon.denyer?fref=ts","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T17:15:28.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hEBZ_bCAfRquVZDWHuC3y5rgK30=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HFLJPUCPRAI6RBFAIWFBVKNMBI.jpg","digest":"zUqrJs5aPrhvsCmM7Nz+tg==\n"}

Plus, he's adding 75 million shares to Berkshire Hathaway's already substantial holdings of 165 million shares, he said on Tuesday.\n\nBut for Apple investors and observers, his justification for buying so much Apple stock may be more interesting than his big purchase.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, he laid out the bull case for Apple.\n\nBasically — Buffett says that Apple makes a ton of money and you don't need to worry about quarter-by-quarter iPhone sales, like many Wall Street analysts do in their research.\n\nHere are his full comments:\n\nIt is an unbelievable company. If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States. It's a wide, wide gap. It's an amazing business.\n\nHere's a company that's, whatever the earnings are, 60 billion, or whatever, and you can put all their products on a dining room table. That's not the way it used to be in this country.\n\nWe don't own it for the next quarter. it's incredible to me, how you read the investor conference calls after reports, you read all the analyst reports and they talk about what it's going to do next year.\n\nNobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year or not. They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years.\n\nThe relevant question when you're looking at buying part of a business, which you're doing when you buy a stock is where it's going to be in 10 or 20 years. It may be you don't know, in which case you don't have to do anything!\n\nThe idea that spending loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X or whatever are going to be sold in a given 3-month period, to me, it totally misses the point. It's like worrying about the number of BlackBerrys 10 years ago, what really counts is what's going to happen over the next 10 years.\n\nHis comments were referring to a slew of headlines and investor notes before Apple earnings earlier this week that forecasted gloom and doom.\n\nHere's one from Business Insider: \"Apple may have lost more than a third of its market share in China.\"\n\nBloomberg, on April 30: \"Apple Results to Show iPhone Growth Problem and Cook's Plan to Fix It.\"\n\nHere's the headline of a April 16 note from Goldman Sachs: \"How bad is June and what does it mean for Apple?\"\n\nBut when Apple reported earnings on Wednesday, it posted another impressive quarter: $61 billion in revenue for Q2, up 16% year-over-year, and strong guidance for next quarter.\n\nThese headlines suggest their authors have a model of Apple that is \"hits\" based. Like a movie studio and blockbuster movies, many analysts parse numbers to guess how many iPhones were sold in any given quarter — was the new one a hit or not?\n\nIt's a defensible stance, considering that the iPhone contributes about 70% of Apple's overall revenue. But since iPhone sales are not recurring, much of the modeling consists of guessing how long people will hold onto theirs before getting a new one.\n\nBut Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are big \"value investors\" — that is, they look for companies that are undervalued based on underlying principles and long-term strategy, then it holds the shares for a long time.\n\nBased on that, he's seeing a company that just raised its dividend, has always has a forward price-to-earnings ratio that lags behind its technology peers, and sells the top four best-selling smartphones in the world.\n\nBasically — it really doesn't look like Apple will be collapsing like BlackBerry did over the past decade.\n\nIn that light, it doesn't really matter if Apple sold 53 million iPhones, as the Street predicted, or if it sold 52.2 million, as it reported on Tuesday.\n\nAnd that's what Buffett meant when he said analysts \"totally miss the point.\"\n\nSo far, at least one important person is applauding Buffet. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC \"We are thrilled to have Warren and Berkshire as a major investor. On a personal level, I've always greatly admired Warren and have always been grateful for his insight and advice.\"","author":"Kif Leswing","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T15:58:57.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5aec7a1519ee865b008b48bf-640-320.jpg","digest":"2JPkV1UcoBCaO27m8wBK6g==\n"}

(Reuters)\n\nA federal judge in Virginia on Friday accused the office of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III of pursuing a fraud case against President Trump’s former campaign manager to pressure him to “sing” and provide evidence against the president.\n\nThe comments from Judge T.S. Ellis III came during a hearing in Alexandria federal court, where attorneys for Paul Manafort argued that bank- and tax-fraud charges against him are outside the scope of the special counsel’s authority.\n\n“You don’t really care about Mr. Manafort’s bank fraud,” Ellis told prosecutors at the morning hearing. “You really care about getting information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment.”\n\nEllis said the government wanted Manafort, “the vernacular is, to sing.” The judge put it another way, saying the special counsel set out to “turn the screws and get the information you really want.”\n\nManafort, 69, is accused in federal court in both Alexandria and the District of Columbia of crimes related to his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Manafort served as Trump’s campaign chief for five months before resigning amid news reports that he had received secret cash payments for his Ukraine consulting.\n\nMichael Dreeben, a prosecutor with the special counsel’s office, did not respond specifically to the judge’s assertions. But he said the investigation fit naturally into a probe of Trump campaign ties to Russia: “In trying to understand the actions of Mr. Manafort in Ukraine and the association he had with Russian individuals and the depths of those financial relationships, we had to follow the money where it led.”\n\nManafort’s attorneys contend that their client’s alleged crimes in Virginia have nothing to do with the election or with Trump.\n\nEllis agreed, emphasizing that some of the charges involve purported conduct that occurred over a decade ago. But he made no immediate decision on the defense motion to dismiss. The judge said that even without such a connection, the special counsel, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, may well still have the authority to bring the charges.\n\n“I’m not saying it’s illegitimate,” Ellis said.\n\nBut the judge did question why an investigation into Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed over to federal prosecutors in New York while the Manafort case was kept with the special counsel.\n\nEllis suggested that if he ruled in Manafort’s favor, the case could simply be returned to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nIt is precisely because the probe into Manafort’s financial dealings began years ago with federal prosecutors in that office, Manafort’s defense attorneys argued, that the special counsel should not be involved.\n\n“This doesn’t make any sense,” defense attorney Kevin Downing said in court. “It’s so unrelated,” he said, “as to be in violation” of the special counsel’s mandate.\n\nDreeben responded in court that the Manafort investigation has expanded significantly since it was taken over by Mueller. “Our investigation has considerably advanced and deepened our understanding” of Manafort’s actions, he said.\n\nThe reason the specific parameters of the special counsel’s investigation have not been publicly revealed, Dreeben said, is that to do so would jeopardize ongoing probes and sensitive national security information.\n\n“It would make no sense for the facts to be conveyed publicly,” he argued. Instead, he said, the scope has been defined in “ongoing discussions” with Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the investigation.\n\nDreeben also referred to an August memorandum from Rosenstein authorizing Mueller to investigate whether Manafort illegally coordinated with Russia in 2016.\n\nEllis asked for an unredacted version of that memo. Dreeben told the judge that all sections of the memo related to Manafort have been publicly revealed. Significant sections remain classified.\n\nDowning said he would also like a copy of any written records justifying Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. Downing noted he had worked under the deputy attorney general for five years and knows that “Mr. Rosenstein is a stickler for memos being written.”\n\nManafort has argued that Rosenstein improperly gave Mueller a “blank check” to investigate the Trump campaign.\n\nEllis appeared somewhat sympathetic to this argument as well, comparing Mueller to independent counsels criticized in the past for overreach.\n\n“The American people feel pretty strongly about no one having unfettered power,” he said.\n\nDreeben countered that the special counsel is part of the Justice Department and thus subject to oversight that addresses such concerns. The tax division and national security division signed off on the Manafort indictment, he said.\n\n“We are not operating with unfettered power,” he said. “We are not separate from the Justice Department.”\n\nEllis is known to be tough on attorneys in court, but those who have appeared before him often say that pressure offers little insight into his ultimate ruling.\n\n“Judge Ellis has high expectations from counsel on both sides of any issue,” said Timothy Belevetz, a former prosecutor in the Eastern District now with the firm Holland \u0026 Knight. “His interactions with counsel in the courtroom do not necessarily reflect where he’ll end up coming out, because he’s a thoughtful judge who takes into account and carefully analyzes what’s presented to him. But in the meantime, he probes counsel and does so thoroughly.”\n\nManafort has made similar arguments in D.C. federal court, where he faces charges of money laundering, making false statements, failing to follow lobbying disclosure laws and working as an unregistered foreign agent. He is set to go to trial there Sept. 17.\n\nEarlier this week, Manafort’s attorneys accused government officials of falsely telling reporters that conversations between their client and Russian officials were intercepted.\n\nMueller’s attorneys have no evidence of any such conversations to turn over, the defense said.\n\nManafort also is arguing that one of the charges against him, failing to register as a foreign agent in 2011, is too old to be prosecuted and that the searches of his home and storage unit were unconstitutional.\n\nManafort’s attorneys requested that the judge address the motion alleging leaks and other issues at a hearing set for May 25.\n\nMueller has requested 70 blank subpoenas in preparation for Manafort’s July 10 Virginia trial. He also has added an attorney from the office of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to his legal team for the case: Uzo Asonye, who in 2016 prosecuted Norfolk Treasurer Anthony Burfoot for corruption.\n\nEllis expressed satisfaction with Asonye’s involvement, having pushed Mueller at an earlier hearing to add local counsel to his team.\n\nThe judge noted with pleasure that the fraud prosecutor has appeared before him several times.\n\n“He may tell you some interesting things,” Ellis said.","author":"http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T15:27:03.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png","digest":"SN/fPhoAI7SGJ2Zs6YYrqg==\n"}

Though many conservative South Koreans value their presence, there are many who would like to see them go.\n\nWhat has really changed now, however, is there is a U.S. leader who has also repeatedly suggested that, in general, foreign nations that host U.S. troops should pay far more for their upkeep, or they should be withdrawn.\n\nWith the coming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump likely to take place in just a few weeks, here is a rundown of the current positions on U.S. troops in South Korea for the three stakeholders.\n\nHistorically, North Korea has demanded U.S. troops be withdrawn from South Korea. It has claimed annual drills the U.S. military conducts with the South Korean military were a pretext for invasion — an understandable position, as the drills have included mock “decapitation” attacks against North Korean leaders.\n\nSome critics argue North Korea simply wants U.S. troops to leave the peninsula so Pyongyang can finally use its military against South Korea, either blackmailing it into concessions or even attempting to forcefully reunify the two Koreas. However, it is hard to imagine the North Korean army, even with its superior manpower, could easily overpower South Korea — or that the United States would not intervene, regardless of whether USFK had withdrawn.\n\nWhat is noteworthy right now is Kim appears to have dropped his demand for U.S. forces to leave South Korea ahead of his summit with Trump. There was no hint of it in the joint declaration Kim signed with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in; indeed, Moon later told reporters North Korea was no longer insisting on U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nNorth Korea “is not making demands that the U.S. cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of the U.S. forces in Korea,” Moon said, according to the JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper. Instead, Moon said, North Korea was simply seeking an “end to the hostile policy” and a “guarantee of its security” in return for abandoning its nuclear and missile program.\n\nIt is not clear why Kim would have dropped this demand, and many are skeptical. However, some analysts have suggested Kim may know it is simply unrealistic — or even that North Korea may view a U.S. presence on the peninsula as a useful counterweight to other regional forces, such as  China.\n\nThe South Korean government said clearly this week the presence of U.S. troops in the country was a matter for Seoul and Washington, not Pyongyang.\n\n“U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are an issue regarding the alliance between South Korea and the United States. It has nothing to do with signing peace treaties,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, cited Moon as saying Wednesday.\n\nMost polls suggest the majority of South Koreans support the current numbers of U.S. troops in the country. A survey conducted for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in 2015 found 61 percent of South Koreans thought U.S. troop numbers in the broader Asia-Pacific region should be kept as is.\n\nHowever, the U.S. presence in South Korea has long been politically divisive in the country, with some on the far left pushing for troop withdrawal — a position that has been aggravated in the past by high-profile crimes and accidents involving U.S. service members and the perception that Washington was undermining the chances for peace with North Korea.\n\nSince entering office, Moon has been a moderate on U.S.-South Korea relations, but there has been doubt sown by his allies. In a widely shared Foreign Affairs article published this week, Blue House foreign policy adviser Moon Chung-in wrote it would “be difficult to justify [U.S. troops'] continuing presence in South Korea” if a peace treaty were signed.\n\nThe adviser Moon later clarified his comments to say he had not meant he himself supported withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea.\n\nU.S. political and military leaders have generally been steadfast in their support of USFK. The general public is also generally supportive of the stationing of U.S. troops in South Korea — according to another poll from the Chicago Council from 2016, 70 percent of Americans supported keeping military bases in South Korea as they were.\n\nHowever, Trump has taken a skeptical view of U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. leader has repeatedly suggested wealthy host countries all around the world should do more to support the troops stationed there. Before he was elected, Trump told reporters he would be willing to withdraw troops from South Korea and Japan if they did not increase their contributions.\n\n“I would not do so happily, but I would be willing to do it,” Trump told the New York Times in March 2016. “We cannot afford to be losing vast amounts of billions of dollars on all of this. We just can’t do it anymore.”\n\nTrump's comments later received favorable commentary in North Korean state media. However, he appeared to disregard the considerable costs born by South Korean taxpayers for U.S. bases. For example, the cost of a new mega-base for USFK in South Korea, Camp Humphreys, was largely born by the South Korean government.\n\nSince entering office, the U.S. president has largely avoided talk of withdrawing troops. However, NBC News reported this week Trump had to be dissuaded from withdrawing all U.S. troops in South Korea in February. On Thursday, the New York Times reported Trump had ordered the Pentagon to look at options for reducing the number of U.S. troops in South Korea.\n\nThe White House pushed back strongly against this suggestion Friday, with  national security adviser John Bolton calling it “utter nonsense” and stating Trump “has not asked the Pentagon to provide options for reducing American forces stationed in South Korea.”\n\nLater in the day, Trump said he was not planning to put troop numbers “on the table” during talks with North Korea and added, “we haven't been asked to.” However, he then added: “At some point into the future, I would like to save the money.”\n\nWhat did the Korean leaders talk about on those park benches? Trump, mainly.\n\nThese three Americans are detained in North Korea, but Trump has hinted they’ll soon be free\n\nTalk of peace with North Korea has the South wondering: Will this time be different?","author":"https://www.facebook.com/mradamtaylor","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T15:20:51.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ep0oPnH5Eg2anQijZodD34CYFFw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4D4ZE7ARAZ3BIBC2XLODUB5BY.jpg","digest":"0eGItbLDPnY3NkFmmHZwdA==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aecb5d90a500bdef433288a"},"description":"With 164,000 jobs added in April, it was the 91st consecutive month of gains, far and away the longest streak of increases on record.","title":"Unemployment Rate Hits 3.9%, a Rare Low, as Job Market Becomes More Competitive","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html","text":"The drop in the unemployment rate may be partly explained by a contraction in the labor force last month. Still, the jobless rate is reaching historically low levels. In the last 60 years, there has been only one sustained period where unemployment stayed below 4 percent: the late 1960s.\n\nMs. Barrera said it was too early to worry about whether the economy is overheating. When the jobless rate hit these levels right before the dot-com bubble burst, the labor-force participation rate was significantly higher than it is today.\n\n“It’s easy to try to analogize and say that’s what we should be preparing ourselves for right now,” Ms. Barrera said. That kind of thinking might prompt some employers to cut back on investments or hiring, which could begin to slow growth.\n\nPresident Trump’s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the overall economic picture. The White House has offered little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.\n\nEconomists say it is too soon to tell how employers may change their staffing or expansion plans in response to the tariffs on Chinese goods, or to Beijing’s retaliation. But there are signs that companies that buy metals are feeling the effects already. The Institute for Supply Management said this week that manufacturing activity grew in April at its slowest pace since last July.\n\nUncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\n\nEconomists expect that low unemployment will lead to increasingly big pay bumps for workers as employers fight over a dwindling number of candidates. But this recovery has so far bucked that conventional wisdom.\n\nWages increased by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. That modest uptick probably would not prompt the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate more aggressively than it has signaled, economists said. Projections released at a Fed meeting this week suggested that officials were leaning toward a total of three rate increases this year.\n\n“Wage growth is just not picking up as we would have expected at this point,” said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. As a result, he said, the Fed will be able “to continue moving gradually.”\n\nOne mystery of the American economy is this: How can employers can continue to raise pay so gradually, when the labor market keeps getting tighter? In the 1990s and early 2000s, the last time the job market looked like this, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent.\n\nA host of explanations — ranging from globalization to slow gains in productivity — have been offered to explain the disconnect. Ms. Barrera says businesses may just be stuck in their ways.\n\n“People are creatures of habit,” Ms. Barrera said. “If you have been using a strategy that has been working for you for a number of years, you aren’t going to suddenly change it.”\n\nEven though the labor force shrank over all, the report offered signs that the strong economy is coaxing some people back into the working world. A measure of unemployment that includes people who had given up looking for work hit 7.8 percent, a level not seen since 2001.\n\n“We have realized that there were even more workers on the sidelines than we previously thought,” said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Indeed.com, a job-search site. Ms. Gimbel said that her site had seen an increase in people searching for things like “background check” and “full time,” which could indicate that the bustling job market has become irresistible for workers who might have been discouraged by a particularly bruising recession a decade ago.\n\nFor some groups, the market has been tougher. The unemployment rate for black workers, for example, has consistently hovered well above the rate for white workers, even as employers complain loudly about a labor shortage in sectors like construction and trucking. The job market has improved for black workers in recent years — they still faced a jobless rate of 6.6 percent in April, the lowest level on record. But it was still much higher than the 3.6 percent for whites.\n\nIf the numbers were reversed, “the country would be up in arms,” said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution, whose research focuses on race and structural inequality. Differences in education or degrees don’t explain that gaping disparity, according to federal data.","author":"Natalie Kitroeff","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T14:02:15.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/business/economy/historic-unemployment-1525441578565/historic-unemployment-1525441578565-facebookJumbo-v4.png","digest":"93OsoJObCU4wWHxoyaZRjw==\n"}

Eric Greitens","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/05/04/missouri-lawmakers-set-special-session-to-consider-impeaching-gov-eric-greitens/","text":"The announcement from the Republican-held House and Senate comes as Greitens, a former Navy SEAL once considered a rising star in his party, faces widespread calls to step down amid criminal charges.\n\nThe governor faces a trial this month on a felony invasion-of-privacy charge for allegedly taking an unauthorized, nude photo of a blindfolded woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Last month, Greitens was also charged with two felony counts of computer tampering stemming from allegations that he used a veterans charity donor list to raise funds for his 2016 campaign for governor without the permission of the group, which he founded.\n\nIt is the first time in Missouri’s history that state legislators have called for a special session, House Speaker Todd Richardson (R) said in a news conference Thursday. The special session is set to begin on May 18, just days after the start of Greitens’s criminal trial, and will last no more than 30 days. It will allow lawmakers to continue investigating the governor’s conduct and consider taking disciplinary action against him, Richardson said.\n\n“This path is not the one that I would have chosen for Missourians or my colleagues,” Richardson said. “I have hoped from the beginning of this process that the committee would find no wrongdoing so that we could bring this investigation to a close. … Unfortunately this is where the facts led.”\n\nGreitens, a married father with two children, admitted in January to having an affair before he ran for governor. But he has denied any criminal activity and declined to testify before a House committee. The defiant governor has showed no signs that he is preparing to leave office claiming, like President Trump, that he is the target of a “witch hunt.” He has asserted that his criminal trial this month will exonerate him.\n\nThe House has already released two scathing reports against the governor. The first provided dramatic evidence of an extramarital affair with Greitens’s former hairdresser, who the committee deemed a “credible witness.” The woman testified that in 2015, before Greitens’s gubernatorial run, he groped her, slapped her and threatened to blackmail her. She alleged that he blindfolded her and taped her hands to exercise equipment and that she felt “coerced” to perform oral sex on him.\n\nThe second House report, released Wednesday, detailed allegations that Greitens used a donor list from a private charity to raise campaign funds, lying about it to the state’s ethics commission.\n\nIn response to the report, the governor released a statement on Facebook from Catherine Hanaway, legal counsel to his campaign and former speaker of the Missouri House. The report “does a tremendous disservice to the U.S. and Missouri Constitutions,” the statement read. “Even though the report alleges that a false campaign report was filed, the Chairman did not allow the campaign an opportunity to be heard. He never asked the campaign to testify before his committee, nor did he request that the campaign provide any documents to his Committee.”\n\nRichardson on Thursday disputed this, saying that from the beginning, the House committee “has made itself available” to testimony from the governor, welcoming any documents and witnesses from his legal team. “So the assertion that the committee has not done its work in reviewing all the evidence is not something I agree with.”\n\nRichardson said the session will give lawmakers “the time it needs to conduct a fair, thorough and timely investigation” without being halted by the end of regular session.\n\n“We will not avoid doing what is right just because it is hard or just because it was not the path we hoped to travel,” Richardson said. “Therefore we have taken the unprecedented step to continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead.”\n\nThe petition to hold a special session was signed by 138 members of the state House and 29 in the Senate, well over 80 percent of both chambers, said State Sen. Ron Richard (R), president pro tem of the Missouri Senate.\n\nThe session could lead to an impeachment, which would be a first for a Missouri governor, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The only state official to be ousted by impeachment was Missouri Secretary of State Judi Moriarty in 1994.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Greitens, the Senate would then appoint a panel of seven judges to conduct a trial on whether to remove him from office, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRichardson said he already spoken with retired judges about the process of preparing a potential trial panel.\n\n“We stand ready to do it if called upon,” he said.\n\nGreitens’s political crisis began in January. Following the initial news reports about the allegations, the governor became the target of investigations by the state attorney general, a St. Louis prosecutor and a house committee.\n\nAll of Missouri’s top Republican and Democratic leaders, in addition to Greitens’s top private donor, have called on him to step down. But Greitens has refused to budge. After being charged with computer tampering last month, he accused the prosecutor of wasting taxpayer money.\n\n“I will have my day in court. I will clear my name. This prosecutor can come after me with everything she’s got, but as all faithful people know: In time comes the truth. And the time for truth is coming,” he said in a statement.\n\nFox’s Cavuto to Trump: ‘That’s your stink.

A medical team, including 12 surgeons, removed it in a five-hour procedure February 14 at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, according to Dr. Vaagn Andikyan , a gynecologic oncologist for Western Connecticut Health Network and a lead surgeon on the case.\n\n\"During the surgery, we removed this gigantic tumor that originated from her left ovary. We removed her left ovary, her left (fallopian) tube, and we removed the affected peritoneal tissue that was adhering to the ovary,\" Andikyan said.\n\nThe tumor originated in the epithelial cells lining the ovary and was \"mucinous,\" meaning it was filled with a gelatin-like substance produced by the tumor cells, according to Andikyan.\n\n\"Ovarian mucinous tumors tend to be big,\" he said. \"But tumors this big are exceedingly rare in the literature. It may be in the top 10 or 20 tumors of this size removed worldwide.\"\n\n\"There were a lot of issues related to this very large tumor in the abdomen. She can't eat, she can't walk, and there are problems related to potential complications with this large mass compressing the venous system,\" Chuang said. \"She was at very high risk of developing blood clots because of compression of the blood flow.\"\n\nIn the newly reported case, physicians removed the 132-pound tumor as well as 6 pounds of abdominal wall tissue and excess skin that had been stretched by the tumor. The doctors also had to reconstruct the patient's abdomen, which had become disfigured due to the mass, according to Chuang.\n\n\"The abdomen was so pushed out that there were a lot of problems with the abdominal wall,\" he said. \"So Dr. Andikyan had to consult a plastic surgeon to do reconstructive surgery afterwards.\"\n\nWhen the patient first met with the doctors at Danbury Hospital, she was severely malnourished and could not walk due to leg swelling and the weight of the tumor. She needed to use a wheelchair to get around, according to Andikyan.\n\n\"When I first walked into the examination room, I found this 38-year-old malnourished patient with a weight of 350 pounds and extensive tumor that was about 100 centimeters [39 inches] large. I saw fear in the patient's eyes. She was so hopeless, because she had seen several other doctors, and they were unable to help her,\" Andikyan said.\n\n\"Her legs were so swollen that she was unable to walk. I've seen leg swelling, but I've never seen leg swelling of this magnitude,\" he added.\n\nDuring the procedure, an anesthesiologist and cardiologist also worked to maintain the patient's blood pressure, particularly when the tumor was lifted off of the patient's major blood vessels.\n\n\"As soon as we starting removing the tumor, the blood pressure of the patient started dropping. So cardiology and the anesthesia team was able to adjust intraoperative management to support her heart and lungs to be able to continue with surgery,\" Andikyan said.\n\nThe physicians were able to save the patient's uterus and right ovary, meaning she can still bear children if she chooses, according to Andikyan.\n\n\"The good part about this story is, we were able to save her reproductive organs,\" he said. \"As of right now, she's not interested in having more children, but she wanted to have the opportunity, and we were very careful to avoid damage to underlying reproductive organs.\"\n\nNow, almost three months since the surgery, the patient is recovering well and has returned to work as a teacher.\n\n\"We wanted to let people know, but we wanted to wait until the patient was really doing well in the postoperative period. And it's been three months, and she's really doing great,\" Chuang said.\n\n\"Luckily, she did not require any additional treatment. She's back to a normal life, she's back to work, and when I saw her in my office, I saw smiles, I saw hope, and I saw a happy woman who is back to her normal life and her family,\" Andikyan added.\n\n\"If there's any complaining about stomach fullness or discomfort or indigestion, it's really important to bring it to the attention of your doctor or health care provider,\" Chuang said.\n\nAlthough ovarian tumors and cancer aren't the most common cancer in women, Chuang had this warning: \"It is a very deadly cancer if it's not diagnosed in the early stage.\"","author":"Mark Lieber, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-03T22:12:22.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180503164342-01-ovarian-tumor-132-pounds-super-tease.jpg","digest":"MP6XuqP4qC6Wx/bM0qqPvg==\n"}

It was foolish of me to ignore them,” Musk tweeted.\n\nThe two analysts were not immediately available for a comment.\n\nThe spat comes at a crunch time for Tesla, when it is struggling to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, on which its profitability depends. It is trying to build 5,000 of the vehicles per week by the end of June and overcome manufacturing hurdles that have delayed its rollout.\n\nAlthough Musk has insisted the company neither needs nor wants new funding, many believe the company will seek to raise more capital by the end of 2018.\n\nTesla’s stock recovered a little on Friday, up 2.4 percent at $291 in early afternoon trade. But short sellers, who shorted nearly 400,000 shares on Thursday, doubled that amount on Friday, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.\n\n“Musk’s meltdown will change Tesla’s ability to raise capital when he needs it with a sector of investors,” said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm.\n\n“At this critical point, he needs to reinforce confidence, not raise a narrative of him as unstable and whose rational side is lost in space,” said Schiffer, who does not hold Tesla shares.\n\nJefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said the underlying business fundamentals were more important in any capital raise, although “management credibility” was also a factor.\n\n“That has an impact but it’s not something that will prevent them from raising capital,” Houchois said.\n\nNord LB analyst Frank Schwope said that Musk’s refusal to answer questions or receive criticism was “not very clever” but added that his ability to find new money was still intact.\n\nThe questions Musk cut short on Wednesday related to Model 3 reservations and capital requirements.\n\n\"The 'dry' questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors,\" Musk tweeted on Friday. twitter.com/elonmusk\n\n“HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them,” he wrote. On the call, he devoted 23 minutes to 25-year-old Tesla investor, Galileo Russell, who runs HyperChange TV.\n\nAt least three brokerages cut price targets on the stock following the call.\n\nSacconaghi, one of the rebuffed analysts, wrote: “We do worry that such theatrics will unnecessarily undermine investor confidence in Tesla’s outlook.”\n\nSacconaghi has a price target of $265 on Tesla’s stock and Spak lowered his target to $280 from $305 on Thursday. Tesla’s median Wall Street price target is $317.","author":"Supantha Mukherjee","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T14:59:23.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258561067\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE430SI","digest":"Y5NGjNq0pPvX3g+7OBlj3A==\n"}

Friday, authorities continued to warn residents to stay out of the area as molten rock shot high into the air from cracks in the ground in Leilani Estates, a subdivision in the Puna district.\n\nThe Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said there was “active volcanic fountaining” in the neighborhood, meaning the lava was springing up from ground fractures; reports indicated it was shooting 80 to 100 feet into the sky. The U.S. Geological Survey said at least three fissure vents have opened in the subdivision so far — and that more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone.\n\nAt least two homes in the subdivision caught fire, Hawaii News Now reported.\n\nAs Kilauea roared to life, the deafening sound of grinding rocks echoed in the air and fiery red-orange lava could be seen spurting from the ground.\n\n“It sounded like there were rocks in a dryer that were being tumbled around,” said Jeremiah Osuna, who lives near Leilani Estates. “You could hear the power of it pushing out of the ground.”\n\nEmergency officials reported dangerously high levels of sulfur dioxide in the evacuation area and warned: “Elderly, young, and people with respiratory issues need to comply with the mandatory evacuation order and leave the area.” Residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens were ordered to evacuate to two nearby community centers serving as shelters, and the state’s Department of Education announced that several schools would be closed due to “volcanic activity.”\n\nA state of emergency was issued by the County of Hawaii’s acting mayor, and Gov. David Ige (D) issued an emergency proclamation and activated Hawaii’s National Guard to help with evacuations.\n\nLess than an hour after the eruption began Thursday, wailing warning sirens joined the cacophony, Maija Stenback, a resident of Leilani Estates, told The Post.\n\nAs dramatic as the sights and sounds were, the eruption and lava flow pose little threat to peoples’ lives, thanks to a monitoring and alert system in place for years.\n\n“It’s been handled very well,” Stenback said. “Civil Defense has been saying they can’t predict it, but there’s a good possibility, so they made everybody very aware that this could happen. You know, pack a bag and be ready to leave.”\n\nKilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on Hawaii Island, according to USGS. The eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island on Thursday morning. Since Monday, the area has been rattled by at least 600 smaller quakes generated by magma flow from Kilauea, Janet Babb, a geologist with the Hawaiian Volcanoes Observatory, told The Post.\n\n“Earthquakes were happening every 10 minutes, it seems like. That was kind of unsettling,” Osuna told The Post, adding that it was “nerve-racking” not knowing exactly where the eruption would occur.\n\nThe event has been building for several days, Babb said, and the tremors were a sign that magma could break through the surface at any time.\n\nThursday’s strong earthquake, which struck at about 10:30 a.m. local time, caused “rockfalls and possibly additional collapse into the Pu’u Oo crater on Kilauea,” and sent a large plume of ash into the air, the USGS reported.\n\nThe collapse began Monday as magma, which supported the crater, moved out and down the rift zone, triggering the quakes, Babb said.\n\n“Eruption was possible, and that’s now what has happened,” she said. “Magma has made its way to the surface, and eruption has commenced.”\n\nWhen Stenback got a call from her son that the volcano had started erupting, it felt “unreal,” she said.\n\nIt wasn’t until she and her daughter saw lava coming up through the ground that she believed it.\n\n“Once you see it, then you know it’s really happening,” said Stenback. She added that she even hesitated to pack because she didn’t think the eruption would occur.\n\nBut after seeing and filming the lava, Stenback said she and her daughter high-tailed it home to prepare to evacuate.\n\n“We were trying to figure out what’s the most important thing to grab,” she said.\n\nIn addition to collecting legal documents and medication, Stenback said she quickly grabbed sentimental pieces from her jewelry box and stuffed the items into the pockets of her shorts because she didn’t have time to properly pack her suitcase. She said her family will stay with friends in Hilo, about 25 miles away, until it is safe for them to return.\n\nMany residents took to social media to share photos and videos of the eruption.\n\nOn Twitter, one person wrote, “OMG my island is on fire” and included a video of lava gushing from the middle of a road.\n\nOthers also expressed worry, with a user tweeting, “Friends on the mainland asked me if I am OK. I am, not my island.”\n\nSince 1983, Kilauea has erupted almost continuously, many times forcing nearby communities to evacuate.\n\nGeologists said the current seismic activities around Puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption, according to Hawaii News Now. That eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava, the news site reported.\n\nMore recently in 2014, lava again threatened the Puna district, specifically the town of Pahoa and its surrounding area, The Post reported. During that event, lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour and up to 60 structures were at risk.\n\nIn comparison, Thursday’s eruption seems much more tame, as the USGS reported that lava spatter and gas bursts erupted for about two hours and the lava spread less than 33 feet from the fissure.\n\n“At this time, the fissure is not erupting lava and no other fissures have erupted,” according to a statement from the service released shortly after 10 p.m. local time.\n\nHowever, Babb said the inactivity doesn’t mean the event is over, and there is no way to forecast how long the eruption could last. Early Friday morning, Civil Defense also said that the fire department had detected “extremely high levels of dangerous Sulfur Dioxide gas in evac area.”\n\nBesides, the USGS noted, “the opening phases of fissure eruptions are dynamic and uncertain. Additional erupting fissures and new lava outbreaks may occur. It is not possible at this time to say when and where new vents may occur.”\n\nHawaii County Mayor Harry Kim tweeted that the civil defense agency “is on high alert on a 24-hour basis for possibility of eruption in lower Puna.” The areas bordering the eastern part of the rift zone, Kim said, are “at high risk for eruption.”\n\nFor now, residents are left without any idea of when it might be safe for them to return to home.\n\n“This stuff could go on for a couple days, weeks or months,” Stenback said. “Just the thought of everything now being gone — it’s just not real yet. Maybe the next time we go there the house might be under 30 feet of lava.”\n\nFox’s Cavuto to Trump: ‘That’s your stink.

The suspect or suspects fled the scene after the shooting and authorities said a manhunt was underway, police said.\n\nPolice said a second officer at the scene was also transported to an area hospital for observation after the shooting, but was not shot.\n\nCelinez Nunez, special agent in charge of the ATF's Chicago field office, described the shooting as an \"ambush.\" She said that the wounded agent's condition had stabilized and that he's expected to make a full recovery. Chicago police officers returned gunfire at a suspect, but do not believe that person was hit, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.\n\nSeveral police officers and ATF agents were in the area for what authorities described as an illegal gun interdiction in an area where gun violence has been an ongoing problem. Three Chicago police officers had been shot at in the same area over the last year, according to police.\n\n\"Trust me those are going to have their day in court,\" Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. \"Do you think we're going to take this lying down? This is the fourth law enforcement officer has been shot in that area. Do you think that scares us? Because it doesn't. I have a message for them: We're coming for you.\"\n\nThe incident occurred during an uptick in violence in the nation’s third largest city. At least four people have been fatally shot and 45 wounded since Monday.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has ordered specialized units to assist the ATF in the investigation. The city police department's organized crime, gang, saturation and gun teams are also assisting the investigation.\n\nMore: Chicago to get more ATF agents to fight gun violence\n\nMore: Spring in Chicago: As weather warms, 43 people shot in the city since Monday\n\nMore: Chicago violence: 7 killed in one neighborhood in 12 hours\n\nThe Trump administration announced nearly a year ago that it was increasing the ATF’s presence in the city in an effort to stem gun violence. Chicago saw more than 1,400 murders in 2016 and 2017– more than New York and Los Angeles combined.\n\nWith the additional agents, the agency presence was set to increase to about 61 agents from 41 in the city. The Justice Department also formed a joint strike force of federal and local law enforcement officials to ramp up prosecution of gun-related crimes.\n\nThe wounded ATF agent had recently started work in the Chicago area, Nunez said.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly railed on Chicago for its handling of the violence, referring to the situation as \"horrible carnage\" and \"out of control.\"\n\nA veteran Chicago cop, Cmdr. Paul Bauer, was fatally shot on Feb. 13 after police got in a foot chase with a suspect. The suspect in Bauer's killing, Shomari Legghette, 44, faces murder, weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, the neighborhood where the ATF agent was shot was saturated with hundreds of Chicago cops and federal agents searching for the individual or individuals involved in the shooting.\n\nThe ATF, FBI, U.S. Marshals service and a local anti-violence activist, Andrew Holmes, announced a combined $61,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction for those responsible for the shooting.\n\n\"We need the community,\" said Jeffrey Sallet, special agent in charge of the FBI's Chicago division. We are out there protecting your community and our community and we need your help.\"","author":"Aamer Madhani","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T19:14:10.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e147e0cbd31e3f3a523f14880ae5d65865f526ee/c=0-193-3800-2340\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636610193867114495-Chicago-violence-ATF-agent.JPG","digest":"hl7b6BJUt34LOMj+ObWddg==\n"}

Data for March was revised up to show the economy adding 135,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 103,000. That was the fewest amount of jobs created in six months and followed an outsized gain of 324,000 in February.\n\nWhile cold weather in March and April probably held back job growth, hiring is moderating as the labor market hits full employment. Employers, especially in the construction and manufacturing sectors, are increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers.\n\nThe drop of two-tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in March pushed it to a level last seen in December 2000 and within striking distance of the Fed’s forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. It was the first time in six months that the jobless rate dropped.\n\nBut 236,000 people left the labor force in April, adding to the 158,000 who quit in March. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8 percent last month from 62.9 percent in March. It was the second straight monthly drop in the participation rate.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 192,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate falling to 4.0 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent last month after a 0.2 percent gain in March. That left the annual increase in average hourly earnings at 2.6 percent.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Friday he did not see “any rapid increase in inflation coming.”\n\n“I feel this is pretty much a Goldilocks economy,” Williams said in an interview with broadcaster CNBC.\n\nThe dollar shrugged off the employment data, rising to its highest level this year against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street rallied and U.S. Treasury yields rose.\n\nSluggish wage growth and a slowdown in hiring threaten to undercut the Trump administration’s argument that its $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January and is highlighted by a sharp drop in the corporate income tax rate, would boost wages and hiring.\n\nCompanies like Apple have used their tax windfall for share buybacks and dividends.\n\nPresident Donald Trump cheered the drop in the unemployment rate on Friday.\n\n“I thought the jobs report was very good. The big thing to me was cracking 4,” Trump told reporters. “That hasn’t been done in a long time ... we’re at full employment. We’re doing great.”\n\nDemocrats, however, reiterated their criticism of the tax cuts, saying more than $390 billion in share buybacks had been announced since the passage of the tax bill.\n\n“President Trump promised American families that they would see a $4,000 annual raise after the tax plan, so far, average weekly wages have increased $11.69,” Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich said.\n\nBut average hourly earnings could be understating wage inflation. The Employment Cost Index, widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack, showed wages rising at their fastest pace in 11 years during the first quarter.\n\nInflation is flirting with the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, was up 1.9 percent year-on-year in March after a 1.6 percent rise in February.\n\nThe U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and said it expected annual inflation to run close to its “symmetric” 2 percent target over the medium term.\n\nEconomists interpreted symmetric to mean policymakers would not be too concerned with inflation overshooting the target. The Fed hiked rates in March and has forecast at least two more increases for this year.\n\nEconomists expect the unemployment rate will drop to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Monthly job gains have averaged about 200,000 this year, more than the roughly 120,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\nA broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.8 percent last month, the lowest level since July 2001, from 8.0 percent in March.\n\nConstruction payrolls rebounded by 17,000 jobs last month after recording their first drop in eight months in March. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs in April after a gain of 22,000 positions in March.\n\nPayrolls for temporary help, seen as a harbinger of future permanent hiring, rose by 10,300 after falling by 2,100 in March. There was a modest gain in leisure and hospitality employment while wholesale traders laid off workers.\n\nGovernment payrolls fell 4,000 in April amid a decline in education employment at state governments.\n\n“The moderation in job gains over the past two months may mark the beginning of the slow deceleration to a sustainable pace of job gains, which we estimate to be around or a little below 100,000 per month,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.","author":"Lucia Mutikani","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T19:12:24.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258327423\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE43066","digest":"qjBF7+0ryI5tTAO52bO9Dg==\n"}

All of that is possible in a galaxy near you at Walt Disney World. Hollywood Studios has become to place to be for any one who loves Star Wars. In celebration of our favorite galactic series, we've compiled a list of things you have to do for the ultimate Star Wars day at Disney World.\n\nLocated at Disney Springs, The Void is bringing you into the story of Star Wars with the Secrets of the Empire Hyper-Reality Experience. You don what is very similar to a laser tag vest and a virtual reality helmet to go on a mission with Cassian Andor and K-2SO from Rogue One. You'll encounter friends of the Empire and be transported via lightspeed all around the galaxy while you're on your mission. This experience is not one to be missed! While getting to and parking at Disney Springs is free, the experience starts at $30. You can prebuy tickets or purchase once you get to Disney Springs.\n\nThe rest of our ultimate Star Wars day list takes place at Hollywood Studios. If you're going to be coming from Disney Springs and The Void, you can take a bus or drive, but you will need a valid theme park ticket to get into Hollywood Studios.\n\nFor your young padawans between the ages of 4 and 12, Jedi Training is sure to be the highlight of their day! During this experience, kids will be paraded through Hollywood Studios to a stage located next to Star Tours. They will be taught how to use the Force and safely wield lightsabers. They are going to need that training because the temple grounds open up and they will have to fight off Star Wars villains like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren.\n\nIf your child wants to participate in the Jedi Training, you will need to register them at the Indiana Jones Outpost Adventure, which is located between the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! and 50's Prime Time Cafe. The registration opens when the park opens, so be there early, as all spots are first-come, first-served. Your child must be present when you register them. If you really want to get into this experience, make a breakfast reservation for Hollywood and Vine for 8 a.m., which is before park opening, except on Extra Magic Hours days, and be one of the first to register after you're done with your meal.\n\nEvery hour on the hour from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. at Hollywood Studios, the March of the First Order takes place. You'll hear the music start on Hollywood Boulevard, which is the main road into and out of the park. Captain Phasma and a squad of stormtroopers march up Hollywood Boulevard, then stop where Hollywood and Sunset meet to do a small crowd interaction, then continue up to Center Stage by the Chinese Theater. If you want really great photos of Captain Phasma, there is a white line painted on the ground on Hollywood Boulevard. Line up on the sidewalk directly across from where the line ends, on the left side of the road, and she will come very close to you.\n\nThe Star Wars Launch Bay is the place to be if you love meeting characters or looking at movie props. Once you pass under the Launch Bay sign, you can choose your path to start with a 10-minute film, which talks about the impact that Star Wars has had on pop culture, the future of Star Wars, and interviews with top executives at Lucas Films. Then, once you go inside the gallery, you can explore different props and models from the Star Wars films, which leads down into the character meet-and-greet area. In the Launch Bay, there are three different meet and greet locations for Chewbacca, Kylo Ren, and BB-8. If you have a Disney Visa credit card, you can meet Kylo Ren in a separate area, with usually a much shorter wait! Ask any cast member working inside and they can direct you to the location of the meet and greet.\n\nThe ultimate Star Wars day has to include a ride on Star Tours. This 3D motion simulator will take you to planets all over the galaxy! With the announcement of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge coming to Hollywood Studios and Star Wars: The Last Jedi premiering, two new ride sequences have been added to the attraction. You never know what combination of stories you could get. For the extra ultimate experience, you'll want to ride this one twice! Who knows, you could visit Crait from The Last Jedi, The Death Star, or even Batuu on the Galaxy's Edge!\n\nAfter all of the fun, you'll probably be getting hungry. Right next to Star Tours is a quick-service restaurant called Backlot Express. Here you'll find Dark Side Chicken and Waffles! It's the same delicious Mickey waffles that you might get with breakfast, but made into round waffles with Darth Vader on them, served with chicken nuggets and maple syrup. The adult meal costs $11, but the kids' meal, which is plenty big enough to feed an adult, is $8 and it comes with yogurt, carrot sticks, and a drink.\n\nShowing at least five times a day, Star Wars: A Galaxy Far Far Away is a celebration of light and dark side friends. This is located on Center Stage on Hollywood Boulevard. This is the only time during the day you will see characters like Rey, Darth Maul, and Boba Fett all in one place. The show lasts about 20 minutes, and if you wait until after the show is over and head back toward the Launch Bay, you'll see the characters all walk by in a parade of galactic friends and foes.\n\nThere are a ton of Star Wars photo ops all around Hollywood Studios. Some are permanent and some are temporary as the park gets ready to open up two new lands. You're going to want to get pictures outside of the Launch Bay. There are usually a few PhotoPass cast members walking around with lightsabers waiting to take guests' photos. Then, over by Star Tours, there is a speeder bike just as if you were going between trees on Endor. Lastly, down by Baseline Tap House, the construction wall for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is up, but there is a beautiful artist's rendering of what the land is going to look like. There is usually a PhotoPass cast member here as well.\n\nAs it starts to get later in the day, stormtroopers will come out of the Launch Bay to interact and take pictures with guests. This is an unscheduled event, so it doesn't always happen, though most days at Hollywood Studios it does. Stormtroopers will be walking around between the Launch Bay and the Chinese Theater. This is not a standard meet and greet, and there is no PhotoPass cast member to assist you with photos. The great thing about this is how interactive the stormtroopers are with everyone. From telling jokes to moving people along, it's just fun to go and watch them for a little while.\n\nTo top off you ultimate Star Wars day, you're going to need to see Star Wars: A Galactic Spectacular. This fireworks and projection show takes place to Hollywood Boulevard and the Chinese Theater. It's a good idea to get a seat anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour early depending on how busy the park is the day your adventure takes place. This show takes guests through all eight movies in the Luke Skywalker saga and Rogue One. The best seats are either directly in front of the theater or just off to the left toward the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! area. Viewing from the right side of the theater toward the Brown Derby can give more of a blocked view.\n\nWith these 10 activities, you can make any day the ultimate Star Wars day! May the Force be with you.","author":"Megan duBois","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T18:52:43.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Popsugar.com"},"urlToImage":"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/CUZjARGULENBSAWQeMCak5TeZJE/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2018/05/03/822/n/44647013/2793bf995aeb587ad22fa3.22791852_.jpg","digest":"f62mwHOeS97TtY8RupBfEA==\n"}

Colina said in a statement. \"The officer has been relieved of duty and the Miami-Dade State Attorney's office has been contacted.\"\n\nA cell phone video shot by a witness shows a man lying in a yard with his hands on his head. The first police officer approaches him and starts putting handcuffs on the suspect. The suspect, identified as David Suazo in the police report, was not resisting and was lying on his stomach. His hands are being restrained. Suddenly, another officer can be seen running toward him and kicking him in the head.\n\nThat officer then drops to the ground next to the suspect and appears to put him in a headlock.\n\nA woman can be heard expressing shock. \"You didn't have to do all that, buddy. You tripping.\"\n\nCNN has attempted to reach the officer, Mario Figueroa, but has not yet gotten a response. A call to the Fraternal Order of Police was not returned. Figueroa, who has been working for the Miami Police Department for two years, has been suspended with pay pending the outcome of the investigation. State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle says her Public Corruption Unit has opened an investigation into the incident. Four officers surround the suspect, who is on the ground. The witness who shot the video told CNN that she started recording after hearing something happening in her backyard Thursday morning. She requested not to be identified. She said she went outside and saw a man running around, trying to escape. But he couldn't get away because there was a gate, so he surrendered to police, she said. \"He stopped, put his hand on his head and got on his knees. Police told him to lay down and he did,\" she said. \"And the rest is all on video.\" She said she sent the Miami Police Department a message about what happened after seeing the kick. According to the police report, which doesn't mention the kick, Miami police had pursued Suazo, 31, on Thursday morning after spotting him driving a blue Jeep Cherokee that a record check showed to be stolen. Police said they tried to pull him over, but the suspect sped up and drove into a residential complex \"with disregard for the safety of persons or property.\" He crashed the car and fled on foot, as officers gave chase. Officers said they gave verbal commands and the man said, \"F*** you\" to them and took a \"fighting stance,\" according to their report. Figueroa deployed a Taser, which was ineffective, according to the report. The man continued to flee, but was eventually taken into custody. Suazo is charged with grand theft auto, fleeing/eluding police officer, reckless driving, driving with suspended license, leaving the scene of an accident and resisting an officer without violence. CNN reached out to the public defender's office, which said it doesn't comment on pending litigation.","author":"Madison Park, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T17:41:50.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180504133717-miami-police-officer-kicks-suspect-orig-js-00010906-super-tease.jpg","digest":"UWnCL4ufw5QEOcn8j55fcA==\n"}

Holmdel police said the track team was stumbling over human feces \"on a daily basis,\" and one Holmdel source told Patch it happened at least eight times in the past few months.\n\n\n\nTramaglini, 42, competed in the New York City marathon, and he only lives a few miles away from the track, in Matawan. It's very likely he could have used the Holmdel athletic complex for early-morning runs every day. And he was arrested at 5:50 a.m. Monday, April 30, after the school district put up cameras that allegedly caught him in the act.\n\nHolmdel superintendent Robert McGarry did not get back to Patch when asked if the track was even open to the public in the early morning hours.\n\nAnyone familiar with running knows about the unfortunate medical phenomenon of suddenly, very urgently, having to empty your bowels in the middle of a run. It even has nicknames: Runners' trots. Mud butt. Both men and women marathoners have been seen crossing finish lines with fecal matter, urine and even menstrual blood streaming down their legs. A Colorado woman nicknamed \"the Mad Pooper\" apologized to a neighboring family after she repeatedly pooped on their lawn during her morning runs.\n\nAnd Superintendent Tramaglini is a serious runner, completing the New York City marathon in 2010 with an impressive finish time of 03:48:25, NJ.com reported.\n\nBut hang on a second, says one former long-distance athlete based in Rumson. That shouldn't happen on a few-mile jog around a high school track before work, and it shouldn't happen with every run, said Doug Rice, the president of the Sandy Hookers Triathlon Club.\n\n\n\n\"Four times around a track is one mile, so let's say he does a max of five miles every morning. And I really don't see him running more than that distance every day,\" said Rice. \"It really shouldn't happen on that kind of run. It's not typical.\"\n\nRice, now 62, has completed 14 Ironmans, which consist of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and then a 26.2-mile run, a full marathon. He has also run three or four independent marathons. His company, Split-Second Racing, now times marathons up and down the Jersey Shore and in New York.\n\nSudden gastrointestinal upset is also really more about what you eat the night before, says Rice.\n\n\"I've been in situations training for an Ironman where we all pigged out on ribs the night before,\" he laughed. \"And yeah, that sent us into the woods the next day.\"\n\nRunner's diarrhea, while much talked about, isn't even all that common, even in marathons, he says.\n\n\"Let's say out of 1,000 runners, you'd maybe have two that have a 'bathroom problem.' That's about the norm,\" he said. \"But it shouldn't happen on a daily run of a few miles. How did he even get through a marathon without stopping every four miles?\"\n\nRice has never met Tramaglini. And the superintendent has declined to speak publicly about his arrest. He shouted \"No comment!\" to reporters camped out in front of his house at 10 a.m. Friday morning.\n\n\"I think he has some kind of issue,\" said Rice. \"But he should address it if he's going to keep running.\"\n\nTramaglini is due in Holmdel municipal court May 30 at 10 a.m. to answer to the charges of lewdness, littering and defecating in public. He has been suspended with pay from his $147,504-a-year job as superintendent of the Kenilworth school system.\n\nPhoto of Thomas Tramaglini from the Kenilworth school district.

A handgun was found at the scene in the Grand Forks home and police said no suspects were being sought. It was not immediately clear if the handgun found was the one used in the shootings, the Grand Forks Herald reported.\n\nPolice went to the home Thursday morning after administrators at Lewis and Clark Elementary School asked police to check on the family.

They said the woman was living there as a renter. Neighbor Paula Stevens, 58, told the Associated Press that she rarely saw the family because the woman worked odd hours and the long winter kept the kids indoors.\n\n\"This is scary,\" Stevens said. \"Now I want to watch out for my neighbors and make sure they're OK.\"\n\nThe Grand Forks Herald reported Volk set up a GoFundMe account last week for help with “living expenses due to medical bills.” Volk wrote on the website that she and her two sons “suffer from mental illness, bi-polar, manic depression, autism and all had been hospitalized for this.”\n\n“I work full time but my wages have recently been garnished for medical bills,” she wrote. “I’m looking for help with 1 month’s bills to help get on our feet and look for a second job. I am trying to stay positive so I do not end up back in the hospital.”\n\nCourt records showed Volk appeared in civil court three times during the past year “for collections totaling to $3,700.” Neighbors said it appeared she was a single mother and may have been separated from her husband, the children’s father.\n\nATF AGENT SHOT IN THE FACE DURING MISSION TO INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL GUNS IN CHICAGO\n\nPolice are continuing to investigate the incident.\n\n\"It's a little frightening because Grand Forks is supposed to be like a safe town, a place where you can keep your doors unlocked,\" said Caralyne Ronai, a senior at the University of North Dakota who was walking through the neighborhood. \"Four dead is upsetting to hear.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","author":"Kathleen Joyce","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T16:54:05.000Z"},"source":{"id":"fox-news","name":"Fox News"},"urlToImage":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/05/04/mother-3-young-kids-found-dead-in-north-dakota-home-in-apparent-triple-murder-suicide/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1525452800388.jpg?ve=1","digest":"HDL3LOFnV94rVAAl1inc1A==\n"}

Thinking it would be a good chance for a selfie, he approached the wild animal. Fellow travelers urged Bhatara to stay a safe distance from the predator, but Bhatara’s desire for a photo brought him within striking distance of the bear, which promptly grabbed the man and mauled him to death.\n\nAccording to forest ranger Dhanurjaya Mohapatra, “Bhatara died on the spot.” Some fellow passengers captured the attack on video, while others threw rocks and sticks at the bear in an attempt to free Bhatara. A stray dog also tried to fight the bear as it was attacking Bhatara but could not save him.\n\nForest rangers were unable to help the man, as their closest post was 6 miles from the site of the attack. Once they arrived, the rangers tranquilized the bear and recovered Bhatara’s body. “The bear is being treated for its injuries,” said Mohapatra.\n\nAround $450 was given to the family to cover funeral costs, the Hindustan Times said. Local residents staged an impromptu protest following the mauling, blocking roads and demanding that larger compensation be paid to Bhatara’s family. Forest officials said they would pay the compensation within 15 days.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nIt is not clear what species of bear killed Bhatara. India is home to three types: the Himalayan black bear, the brown bear and the sloth bear. The first two live in the northern Himalayan region of the country, and sloth bears live all over India, including Odisha.\n\nThe spread of human communities has put pressure on the approximately 20,000 sloth bears in India. They often stray onto local farmland in search of food, leading to confrontation with humans. One Indian research paper found that between 2001 and 2011, 81 people died and 712 people were injured in sloth bear attacks.\n\nSloth bears enjoy protected status in India and cannot be hunted. According to the Red List, published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), sloth bears are “vulnerable,” or one step up from endangered. The IUCN noted that the species was especially vulnerable due to its reliance on lowland areas, which are most readily used by humans. According to Wildlife SOS India, poachers also target bear cubs for use in Chinese medicines and gourmet cuisine in Southeast Asia.\n\nSloth bears were traditionally used for entertainment, forced to dance for spectators. The practice was made illegal in India in 1972, but enforcement was sporadic and facilities for rescued bears almost nonexistent. Wildlife SOS India claimed to have rescued the country's last dancing sloth bear in 2009.\n\n“Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, sloth bear populations are expected to continue declining,” the group said, estimating a more than 30 percent drop over the next 30 years.\n\nThe Hindustan Times said this was the third selfie-related animal death in Odisha in the past year. In December and September 2017, wild elephants killed two young men who tried to take a snap with the gigantic creatures.","author":"David Brennan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T14:39:57.000Z"},"source":{"id":"newsweek","name":"Newsweek"},"urlToImage":"http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/04/sloth-bear.jpg","digest":"gsXcWmzdoFonwBhDuBM10A==\n"}

If the deal falls apart, he could become politically vulnerable for promoting the 2015 accord, under which non-nuclear sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.\n\n“It will also lead to a backlash against the moderates and pro-reformers who backed Rouhani’s detente policy with the West ... and any hope for moderation at home in the near future will fizzle out,” said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian.\n\nIt is a delicate balance. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei knows that Iranians, many of whom took to the streets earlier this year to protest against high food prices, can only take so much economic pressure.\n\nBut the establishment does not want too much of an opening to the West, despite the likely economic benefits. A weakened Rouhani, unable to push such policies, is likely to serve out his term, which ends in 2021, another senior official said.\n\n“His removal would be a sign of weakness for the system. It would harm its legitimacy abroad,” the official said. “But he will be blamed and pressured for the economic malaise.”\n\nKhamenei gave guarded backing to Rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers in order to end Iran’s economic and political isolation.\n\nBut the Supreme Leader’s aversion to the United States remains a formidable barrier to any diplomatic solution now, so a Trump withdrawal would make it hard for Rouhani to pursue better relations with the West.\n\n“The internal politics will make it difficult, if not impossible, for Rouhani to pursue detente with the West and make concessions in return for economic gains,” said another Iranian government official.\n\nThe European signatories of the deal have tried to persuade Trump not abandon it because they want to keep trading with Iran.\n\nDespite threats to walk away if Trump buries the deal, several Iranian officials said that “as long as Tehran was not excluded from the global financial and trading system” it could consider respecting the accord.\n\nBut many foreign firms are hesitant to invest in Iran, worried by unilateral U.S. sanctions imposed over human rights violations, terrorism, and the dominant role of the Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran’s economy.\n\nThat is another area where Rouhani is exposed. He has sought without much success to curb the economic activities of the IRGC in order to attract foreign investment.\n\nBut under the command of Khamenei, the IRGC has ignored the government’s attempts to limit its involvement in the economy.\n\nIf the nuclear deal collapses, what power Rouhani has to limit that involvement will decline further, boosting hardliners who want to see the president’s powers reined in.\n\nThe IRGC has done well since the sanctions relating to the nuclear deal were lifted, using front companies with no obvious link to the Guard to serve as a conduit for investors returning to Iran.\n\nIf sanctions are reimposed as a result of the collapse of the nuclear deal, the Guard is well placed to evade them.\n\n“Considering their vast business network and political and military influence, the IRGC will be back to the business of evading sanctions as they did for years in the past,” said a western diplomat in Tehran.\n\nThe IRGC stepped in when European oil companies abandoned energy projects after the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions in 2012.\n\n“Sepah (the IRGC) is an asset for Iran. They protect Iran whenever needed ... They rescued the economy when the enemies wanted to crush us with sanctions,” said a hardline politician who declined to be identified.\n\n“If European investors yield to America’s pressure and leave Iran, then Sepah will take over,” he said.\n\nConcerns over possible Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities have empowered the IRGC, which runs security at home and abroad.\n\nBut experts believe that even under the umbrella of an emboldened IRGC, hardliners might hesitate to apply harsh policies, fearing a revival of the anti-government protests in January that showed the establishment was vulnerable to popular anger fueled by economic hardship.","author":"Parisa Hafezi","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T14:19:28.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258482264\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE43109","digest":"82BLxvmEj35+BQygzybX0A==\n"}

Irregularities in last November’s presidential election have led to massive street protests, which have turned violent.\n\nSigned into law by President George Bush in 1990, the temporary protected status program once enabled some 435,000 people from 10 countries crippled by natural disasters, war and other strife to live in the United States.\n\n“T.P.S. will still be on the books, but will have been virtually emptied of beneficiaries at a time of the greatest number of forcibly displaced in recent history and an unprecedented number of complex crises giving rise to displacement,” said Donald Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies in New York.\n\nImmigrant advocates and the Honduran government had asked the United States to extend the program, as has happened several times since 1999. This week, more than 600 faith leaders signed a letter asking the administration for an 18-month extension, calling a termination “unconscionable.”\n\n“This can’t be,” said Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo, founder of NOLA Village, an advocacy group in New Orleans, where Hondurans outnumber other Hispanics. “They rebuilt our houses and the city after Hurricane Katrina. When nobody wanted to come, they were here bringing New Orleans back to life.”\n\nOn Twitter, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican congresswoman from South Florida, called the administration’s decision “wrongheaded” and detrimental to families and the economy.\n\nJessica Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, whose members include beneficiaries, said the reversal amounted to a “callous policy.”\n\n“The cancellation of T.P.S. for Honduran immigrants is a death sentence for many of those who would be sent back to a country being roiled by political repression and violence,” Ms. Morales said.\n\nAccording to the Center for Migration Studies, Hondurans with protected status have 53,500 American-born children; 85 percent participate in the labor force, compared with 63 percent of the overall United States population; and nearly 20 percent have mortgages.\n\n“I never took a cent from the government,” said Mr. Contreras, the Long Island contractor.\n\nThe end of protection for his wife, who is from El Salvador, was the first blow to the family of Mr. Contreras, who has become an immigration activist at an organization called Make the Road New York.\n\nThe Trump administration says that a program designed to provide temporary, disaster-related help has instead become a quasi-permanent green light for hundreds of thousands of people. It argues that the only criteria the government should consider in continuing the program is whether the original reason for the designation — in this case, devastation from the hurricane — persists.\n\n“Since 1999, conditions in Honduras that resulted from the hurricane have notably improved,” the Homeland Security Department statement said. “Additionally, since the last review of the country’s conditions in October 2016, Honduras has made substantial progress in post-hurricane recovery and reconstruction from the 1998 Hurricane Mitch.”\n\n“The hurricane was a generation ago, and Honduras long ago reverted to its regular messed-up state, not the special post-hurricane messed-up state required by the T.P.S. statute,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors curbs on immigration. “There can be no honest basis for an extension.”\n\nThe program provides temporary legal status and work permits to people already in the United States, whether they entered legally or not. The Homeland Security secretary decides when a country merits the designation and whether to renew it, if conditions warrant it.\n\nHondurans have been on tenterhooks since last year, when T.P.S. designation for their country was up for renewal. In November, the government allowed it to automatically extend for six months, citing a need for further assessment.\n\nAmong the 86,000 Hondurans who currently have protection under the program, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, 45,600 re-registered for the six-month extension. An unspecified number out of the total have obtained legal status in the United States, the agency said, and, thus, will not have to leave.\n\nT.P.S. holders carry a card that is similar to a driver’s license, which enables them to work legally. They also have Social Security numbers. However, they are not entitled to federal or state loans and other assistance.\n\nCatherine Sarmiento, 23, who has had protected status as a Honduran since age 8, finished four years of college last year and found a job as a nuclear medicine technician at a hospital in Florida. Her parents and sister, also living in Florida under protected status, face the loss of their legal resident status and work permits, too, she said. “We’re all worried,” she said. “The whole family is worried.”\n\nAbout 61 percent of Hondurans lived in poverty in 2016, according to the World Bank, and Honduras has the biggest gap between rich and poor of any country.\n\nMany facing the loss of their protected status said they would resort to living in the shadows, like the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, rather than return to their troubled homeland.\n\nSonia Paz, 55, who arrived in Los Angeles when she was 22 and has three children and grandchildren, said she had no intention of leaving.\n\n“I have nothing in Honduras,” she said. “To go back would be the kiss of death.” Her hometown is San Pedro Sula, notorious for gangs that target people with relatives in the United States for extortion. “They find out that you were in America and take the little you have away from you, or kill you,” she added.\n\nMs. Paz, a nanny in Pacific Palisades, west of Los Angeles, has flown to Washington to advocate for continuation of the program.\n\nHer employer, Julie Silver, said that Ms. Paz is an indispensable member of “the team” raising Sarah, 13 and Katie, 6, with whom she paints, does homework and enjoys meals. Thanks to her, they have learned some Spanish.\n\n“She is completely part of our family. They are taking away her safety net for no reason at all,” Ms. Silver said. “We are going to go to bat for her and support her in any way we can because we love her.”","author":"https://www.nytimes.com/by/miriam-jordan/","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:20:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/us/00hondurans-02/00hondurans-02-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"NJmjQbSp7eBi+4zTU5PHKg==\n"}

His alleged inappropriate behavior toward more than a total of 35 women has been the subject of two Washington Post investigations in the past five months.\n\n“This case is about blatant and repeated sexual harassment committed by Charlie Rose, a 70+ year old powerful American television journalist and talk show host, against three junior female employees in their 20s, and subsequent unlawful retaliation,” according to the complaint, which describes Rose’s conduct as “deplorable.”\n\nCBS News and Rose did not immediately respond to attempts for comment on the litigation. Rose apologized in November for his behavior. In the latest Post report, he called the new allegations “unfair and inaccurate.” CBS News President David Rhodes has said publicly there “was not knowledge” of Rose’s sexual harassment.\n\nIn November, The Washington Post reported on allegations of eight women who said Rose sexually harassed them at his namesake PBS program.\n\nThe Post published a follow-up report this week that revealed an additional 27 accusers who said Rose had acted inappropriately toward them, including groping their bodies and making lewd sexual remarks, among other acts. Fourteen of the women worked at CBS News, where, The Post reported, three managers had been warned about him, as far back as 1986 and as recently as 2017.\n\nTwo of the plaintiffs, Brooks Harris and Chelsea Wei, worked with Rose at “CBS This Morning,” where he was a co-anchor until his Nov. 21 firing. Harris left CBS last April to work for Rose directly at PBS, where the third plaintiff, Sydney McNeal, also worked as one of his assistants. Both Harris and McNeal lost their jobs after Rose’s PBS show was canceled in the wake of the Post’s reporting.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Wei talked last April to Ryan Kadro, the executive producer of “CBS This Morning,” about the attention Rose was paying toward Harris, which Wei said involved out-of-the-office lunches and an attention to Harris she perceived as unusual.\n\n“Ms. Wei also told Mr. Kadro words to the effect of, ‘I’m telling you in case you have a lawsuit on your hands,’” the suit alleges.\n\nIn an email to the Post before the suit, Kadro said he did not believe Wei raised the word “lawsuit” with him.\n\nBut, according to the complaint, the defendants “unlawfully failed and refused to take any remedial action and allowed Mr. Rose to continue to sexually harass” both the plaintiffs and other employees.\n\nAmong the allegations: Rose repeatedly sexually touched the women, including “caressing and touching their arms, shoulders, waist and back, pulling them close to his body and kissing them on the cheek.”\n\nRose repeatedly required Harris to have lunch and dinner with him, where he would place his hands on her thigh and would point at other women and call them prostitutes, according to the claim.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges Rose asked Harris and McNeal to share details of their sex lives, “boasted of his own sexual conquests” and suggested the two women should engage in a sexual relationship with each other.\n\nThe allegations include details of comments Rose made about their intelligence and their ethnicity.\n\nIn one case, the lawsuit alleges, he referred to Wei as a “China Doll” and used an expletive while calling her an “idiot” for booking a flight that did not have flat folding seats.\n\nThe retaliation component of the lawsuit stems from Wei’s account that she was removed from her position as an anchor assistant several months after she filed a complaint with CBS human resources on Nov. 30, just days after Rose was fired. Her complaint included allegations against Kadro, whom she said kicked her chair as a show of intimidation.\n\nKadro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCBS never responded to the complaint, according to the lawsuit, which states the network “subsequently questioned the accuracy of her timesheets and told her that she would be replaced as an anchor assistant and would not be able to apply to work for the show’s new co-anchor, John Dickerson.”\n\nWei has taken medical leave from the show.\n\nThe women’s attorney, Ken Goldberg, of the Manhattan firm Goldberg \u0026 Fliegel, said his clients have a strong claim under New York City Human Rights law, which he describes in the lawsuit as one of the “broadest and most protective laws against discrimination in the nation.” Goldberg said he first reached out to CBS and Rose in February to make them aware of the potential claims.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that in addition to Rose, “one or more other high level male executives at CBS committed acts of sexual harassment against women.” The complaint does not identify the executives.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T19:57:31.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TVybm0in4jXPuatrEtsqnFOlXeo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RAH56CJWMI6RAECCBNEI3IZXA.jpg","digest":"IZGrvucRyFxXD/NoYTU2NA==\n"}

Loads Up on More Apple Stock","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/04/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-inc-loads-up-on.aspx","text":"Since famed investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) began buying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock in early 2016, the conglomerate has continued to load up on shares. Berkshire has purchased so many Apple shares that the tech giant became Berkshire's largest equity holding last year.\n\nBut Buffett \u0026 Co. apparently weren't done buying Apple stock when Berkshire revealed it had accumulated a whopping 165.3 million shares of the company by the end of 2017. On Thursday evening, Buffett said in an interview with CNBC that Berkshire had purchased an additional 75 million shares of Apple during the first quarter, just as analysts were worrying about the near-term trajectory of iPhone sales.\n\nIn addition, Buffett chimed in with some wisdom on why investors shouldn't be wasting their time obsessing over quarterly iPhone X sales. Here's a closer look at Berkshire's big bet on Apple.\n\nIt's difficult to comprehend just how enormous Berkshire's bet on Apple is until you start talking in dollar figures. So, consider this: After adding 31.2 million Apple shares during the fourth quarter of 2017, the value of Berkshire's Apple stock was worth more than $28 billion. But Berkshire's addition of 75 million more Apple shares in Q1, paired with the recent jump in Apple's stock price, brings the value of Berkshire's holdings in the tech giant (now at more than 240 million shares) to an astounding $43 billion.\n\nHighlighting what a significant bet this is for Berkshire, consider that this position is worth about $20 billion more than the company's second-largest equity position in Wells Fargo. At the time of this writing, Berkshire's Apple stake is worth more than Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings (Wells Fargo and Bank of America) combined.\n\nAnd here's one last data point for you: The value of Berkshire's Apple stock is now equal to an incredible 9% of Berkshire's entire market capitalization.\n\nAlong with revealing Berkshire's significantly larger stake in Apple on Thursday evening, Buffett shared his take on the recent intense scrutiny on iPhone sales as supply chain rumors -- and even earnings reports from Apple suppliers -- suggested iPhone X demand could be worse than expected.\n\n\"We don't own it for the next quarter. ... You read all the analyst reports and everybody talks about what it's going to do next year,\" Buffett said. \"Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year or not, they buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years.\"\n\nInstead, investors should zoom out, Buffett advised.\n\nThe relevant question when you're thinking about buying part of a business, which is what you're doing when you're buying a stock, is \"Where's it going to be in 10 or 20 years?\" ... The idea that you're going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X ... are going to be sold in a given three-month period totally misses the point.\n\nFor now, Buffett's view of Apple stock has helped him create value for Berkshire shareholders. Apple shares jumped sharply after the company's fiscal second-quarter report, when Apple reported accelerating revenue and earnings-per-share growth, as well as provided strong guidance for more double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter.\n\nYear to date, Apple stock is up more than 7%, trouncing the S\u0026P 500's 1.7% pullback during this same period.","author":"Daniel Sparks","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T19:45:49.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Fool.com"},"urlToImage":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F481665%2Fbuffett-buys-aapl-stock.jpg\u0026h=630\u0026w=1200\u0026op=resize","digest":"nO2bzus0grq0SGQrA3RLGg==\n"}

Weakness gets you nuclear war. Being weak gets you nuclear war. That’s what gets you nuclear war,” the president said.\n\nIn the past, Trump has employed menacing rhetoric online and in speeches in an attempt to dissuade Kim from pursuing his nuclear ambitions.\n\nIn a September address to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump warned that “rocket man is on a suicide mission,” and threatened that the U.S. “will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea” if America is forced to defend itself or its allies.\n\nIn response, Kim called Trump’s speech “unprecedented rude nonsense” for which the president will “pay dearly,” and pledged to “tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.”\n\nTrump has also referred to Kim as a “maniac” and a “madman.” But the president’s opinion of the dictator has publicly warmed in recent weeks as the prospect of a historic summit between the two leaders has become more likely.\n\n“We’re having very, very good discussions,” Trump said during an April meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France at the White House. “Kim Jong Un was — he really has been very open.

He will also paint a anti-gun violence themed mural as he has done in appearances around the country since his son's death.\n\nIn addition, the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America will host a Day of Action on Saturday aimed at teaching participants how to influence lawmakers, while Faith Forward Dallas, a coalition of faith leaders of many religions, will host a prayer vigil at City Hall Plaza for the duration of the NRA convention.\n\nDiana Earl, whose 22-year-old son, Dedrick, was shot and killed in Austin, came to Dallas to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with others who have lost family members to gun violence.\n\n\"Once you're in this club, you cannot get out of it,\" said Earl, The Dallas Morning News reports. \"This is a club no one wants to be in.\"\n\nA Dallas-based activist group called the North Texas Light Brigade got a early start on protests Thursday night when it projected a light sign on the facade of the convention center that read, \"NRA Enables Domestic Terrorists,\" according to the News.\n\nNRA spokesman Jason Brown said the group has been aware of the planned demonstrations and is taking security precautions. “NRA’s security team has worked closely with local law enforcement to ensure the safety and security of all our members, exhibitors, visitors and staff throughout the event and do not expect any issues to occur,” he said.\n\nIn addition to events planned by gun-control advocates, a counter protest focusing on protecting Second Amendment rights will be held outside City Hall at noon Saturday. It is organized by North Texas Patriots for Liberty, Open Carry Texas and other groups.\n\nTexas is largely a red state where guns are extremely popular: There are more than 300,000 NRA members in the state, according to the Texas State Rifle Association.\n\nAs President Trump began his speech at the nearby NRA-ILA Leadership Forum, more than 100 attendees crowded around two TVs at the NRA-TV booth to hear the president’s remarks. Some wore red “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” baseball caps.\n\nJ.C. Boyli, 70, of Ethel, La., said it was significant that Trump and Pence were speaking at the event and backing gun-rights advocates. Like others in attendance, Boyli said he had come to Dallas in large part because of the nationwide gun control protests that have sparked since the Parkland shooting.\n\n“If we don’t stand up for this side, we’ll eventually lose our freedoms,” Boyli said. “You can’t be passive and expect to be victorious.”\n\nBut Dallas, like other large Texas metropolitan areas, is strongly blue and open to debates on stricter gun control.\n\nMaking its debut outside the meetings will be the newly formed NoRA — or “No Rifle Association” — a coalition of celebrities, activists and policy experts aimed at exposing the NRA’s influence in government. Actress Alyssa Milano said she got the idea to form the group the day after the Parkland shooting and quickly got others to join, including Alec Baldwin, Amy Schumer, Jimmy Kimmel and Parkland survivor David Hogg.\n\nMilano will be speaking at a rally on Saturday in Dallas’ Belo Garden Park. “We should live in a country where people are safe from gun violence,” she said. “We all support the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense solutions.”\n\nGun-control activist Khary Penebaker will also speak at the rally. He said the NRA meetings are an ideal place to shine a light on the 96 gun deaths a day, on average, not just high-profile shootings.\n\n“We can reduce this, we can save people’s lives, and we can respect the Second Amendment,” said Penebaker, whose mother committed suicide with a gunshot in 1979. “But we can’t just show up once in a while. We have to be talking about this constantly.”","author":"Rick Jervis","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T17:12:34.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/01c6d6f47355561d4bbf782f6e54f88b4f44bcd4/c=0-49-4795-2758\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636610304756230937-AP-NRA-Convention-99610341.JPG","digest":"m14iSIF9I66lG8LgjyKYjA==\n"}

The mother of two Native American teenagers who campus police pulled from a Colorado State University campus tour after a parent reported feeling nervous about them said she believes her sons were victims of racial profiling and she feared for their safety after learning about the encounter. (David Zalubowski, File/Associated Press)\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A Native American teenager who was with his younger brother when the two were pulled from a college tour said the ordeal began less than 30 minutes after they had arrived on the Colorado campus. School officials say a parent in the group called the police to report feeling nervous about their presence.\n\n“I think it’s pretty discriminatory,” 19-year-old Thomas Kanewakeron Gray said Thursday. “Me and my brother just stayed to ourselves the whole time. I guess that was scaring people; that we were just quiet.”\n\nGray said police stopped him and his 17-year-old brother, Lloyd Skanahwati Gray, while the Colorado State University admissions tour group was inside a gymnasium Monday, and began questioning the brothers aggressively about why they were on campus that day. Campus police patted down each of the teens and released them only after they were able to provide an email proving they had reserved spots on the tour.\n\nBy then, however, their tour group had moved on without them and the brothers left the campus and returned home to New Mexico.\n\nThe older brother said the school was their first choice, because of its proximity to Denver, where they could attend concerts. The brothers, both Mohawk, are musicians, and study contemporary and traditional music.\n\nThe older of the two brothers is currently a student at Northern New Mexico College in Espanola and hoped to transfer. The younger brother is a high school senior at Santa Fe Indian School.\n\nThe siblings saved until they had enough money to drive the roughly seven hours from the family’s home in Santa Cruz, New Mexico to Fort Collins for the tour.\n\nThe brothers’ ordeal marks the latest in a series of incidences nationwide spotlighting treatment minorities often face in everyday circumstances, including the arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia who were handcuffed and taken to jail after a worker said they had refused to buy anything or leave.\n\nColorado State University officials said in an email to students that it is reviewing what happened to try to avoid similar situations or handle them more appropriately.\n\n“The incident is sad and frustrating from nearly every angle, particularly the experience of two students who were here to see if this was a good fit for them as an institution,” the email said. “As a university community, we deeply regret the experience of these students while they were guests on our campus.”\n\nThe university officials said a parent called police about the brothers, who had joined the tour after it started. According the email, the tour guide did not know that campus police had been called or responded.\n\nThe teens’ mother, Lorraine Kahneratokwas Gray, said she believes her sons were victims of racial profiling and she feared for their safety after learning about the encounter.\n\n“I felt they had been the victim of racism and that they weren’t safe there,” she said in a post this week on Facebook.\n\nShe later told the AP, “I don’t think they even grasped the magnitude of what happened to them until we talked.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Slevin contributed to this report from Denver.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But amid the rapper and Yeezy designer’s latest drama, including controversial tweets supporting President Donald J. Trump, explosive comments calling slavery a “choice” and more, many are wondering if West will make his grand return to the Met Gala staircase alongside his wife this year. As of right now, it seems unlikely.\n\nA Keeping Up with the Kardashians source tells PEOPLE that West escaped to the small ski town, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he is focusing on his upcoming music.\n\n“Kim happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole. She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album,” the insider shares. “The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.”\n\nThe source adds: “Kim is absolutely concerned about Kanye. She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn’t want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.”\n\nLooking for more style content?

Until then, take a look back at the rapper’s most iconic Met Gala moments thus far.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, West accompanied his wife to fashion prom, and the couple commanded the carpet with a signature pose: Kanye always standing to Kim’s right sans smile.\n\nAt their most recent Met Ball appearance in 2016, West wore a dress code-breaking pair of ripped Fear of God jeans teamed with a crystal-covered Balmain jacket and icy blue contacts. Kim matched her man in Balmain, but her look paid homage to the theme, “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.”\n\n“He was wearing these crazy contacts and he really liked wearing denim to the Met,” Kardashian West told Ellen DeGeneres on a recent episode of Ellen. “No one has ever worn denim to the Met Ball so that made him very happy.”\n\nTheir coordinating outfits caught Vogue‘s attention, with the publication naming the duo “best dressed.”\n\n“I’m really excited to get our first best dressed at the met … This Gala is like the Grammys of style,” West Tweeted at the time.\n\nIn 2015, for the “China: Through the Looking Glass” themed-affair, Kim channeled her icon Cher in a sheer crystal-embroidered Roberto Cavalli gown and Kanye selected an all-black velvet suit.\n\nKimye nailed the theme in 2014 celebrating couturier Charles James and both looked like Old Hollywood stars. Kim selected a blue strapless Lanvin gown with a black waistband and thigh-high slit (there had to be a little skin), teamed with black strappy heels, side-swept waves and Lorraine Schwartz danglers. And Kanye actually paid homage to Charles James in a black tux with coattails.\n\nAnd who could forget their Met Gala couple debut in 2013. While Kim’s floral Givenchy gown with the built-in gloves received most of the buzz, her husband supported her outfit choice. Kim was pregnant with the couple first child, North West, at the time.\n\nIn 2012, West hit the Met steps solo in a tux that would make James Bond proud.  The year before, he attended with designer Tory Burch, who created the custom tux he wore for the evening.\n\nAt the rapper’s first-ever Met Gala in 2009, he attended with then-girlfriend Amber Rose and he once again opted for a classic tuxedo this time paired with a rare smile. Rose wore a strapless red dress, matching lip and her chic platinum blonde buzz cut.","author":"Kaitlyn Frey","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:53:51.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"People.com"},"urlToImage":"https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kanye.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1178px%2C618.45px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"fqI4ouYbe+wbDH6XyswEKA==\n"}

Skakel, who had been found guilty of bludgeoning his neighbor with a golf club in 1975.\n\nThe ruling is not only the latest of the many twists in a legal battle that has been drawn out over decades, but could stand as the conclusion of a case that has attracted the attention of tabloids and television newsmagazines with its blend of a cold-case murder with celebrity and wealth.\n\nMr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, had been convicted in 2002 of killing Martha Moxley, a 15-year-old in his Greenwich, Conn., neighborhood. Mr. Skakel, also 15 at the time of the killing, was not arrested until he was in his late 30s. He was convicted after a three-week trial that brought to light details including his drinking and drug use.\n\nHe had initially been sentenced to 20 years to life for murder. He spent more than a decade behind bars before he was released in 2013, when a judge vacated his original sentence after finding that his lawyer had not provided effective representation. In a 2016 decision, the Supreme Court ruled to reinstate the conviction, disagreeing with the lower-court judge’s finding. Prosecutors will now have to decide whether they will try the case again.\n\nThe grisly crime in one of the most affluent suburbs in the country — Ms. Moxley was found lying face down under a Pine tree on her family’s estate — led to years of police investigation, Hollywood movies and books that capitalized on the case’s link to the Kenndy family before.\n\nOne of Mr. Skakel’s most vigorous defenders has been his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former prosecutor and environmental lawyer who in a book published two years ago explored what he said was a bothced police investigation and prosecutorial misbehavior and offered alternative theories about who killed Ms. Moxley.","author":"Rick Rojas","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:34:27.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/nyregion/05Skakel/05Skakel-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"ykI5+Wj9DJuyDQpggesW1w==\n"}

No, but on CNN, they have a headline: 'Judge in Manafort case says Mueller's aim is to hurt Trump.' Do you believe that? This is what we're up [against]. It's called the witch hunt. So, I just said, 'Give me that article. I want to read it.' Just happened a few minutes before I walked onstage.”\n\nTrump then got a bit mixed up. He read aloud a passage that actually came from a similar Wall Street Journal report before returning to the portion of CNN's report that quoted Judge T.S. Ellis, who questioned special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's authority to charge former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort with financial crimes.\n\n“None of that information has to do with information related to Russian government coordination and the campaign of Donald Trump,” Ellis told a prosecutor on Friday.\n\nMueller's probe launched as an effort to scrutinize Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. Ellis's statements suggested he may believe Mueller has exceeded his mandate.\n\nThe Journal reported “the judge appeared sympathetic to Mr. Manafort's efforts to have the charges dismissed, without indicating he was inclined to do so.”\n\nTrump did not read that last part.\n\n“Let me tell you, folks, we're all fighting battles, but I love fighting these battles,” Trump said, wrapping up his thoughts on the subject. “It's really a disgrace.”\n\nTrump liked CNN's report (and the Journal's) for one simple reason: He saw an account of Friday's proceeding in the Manafort case as evidence of the “witch hunt” he has decried for more than a year.\n\nThe president's live reading of a CNN article is a reminder he judges news reports only by whether they are favorable to him.

The president often uses such phrases to hype dramatic possibilities, even if some of them might not pan out or might fall short of his grand pronouncements.\n\nBut in the case of the Americans, Trump and some key surrogates have again shattered long-standing Washington protocols by speaking so openly about delicate negotiations on American detainees, potentially risking a last-minute setback or coming across as insensitive to the privacy of their families, according to former U.S. diplomatic and intelligence officials.\n\n“I think it is pretty obvious to anyone who has ever spent five minutes negotiating with the North Koreans that you do not announce things that have not happened,” said Christopher Hill, a former State Department official who led the U.S. delegation in the six-party talks with Pyongyang during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n“I understand they take pride in doing things differently,” Hill said of Trump’s team. “But this is serious business — people’s lives are at stake. It just takes a little bit of discipline.”\n\nOn Friday, as he departed Washington for a day trip to Dallas, Trump reiterated his cryptic prediction in impromptu remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. He said the administration had worked out a date and location for the Kim meeting — though he declined to reveal them — and added that “a lot of good things have already happened with respect to the hostages.”\n\n“And I think you’re going to see very good things,” Trump said. “As I said yesterday, stayed tuned.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Trump who was predicting success with the prisoners — two of whom were detained since Trump took office, contrary to his inaccurate tweet asserting that the Obama administration had failed to win the release of all three.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has joined Trump’s legal team, said on Fox News, while defending Trump in the controversy surrounding adult film actress Stormy Daniels, that the Americans would be freed by the end of the day.\n\nThey were not.\n\nGiuliani later confessed that he did not have inside information and had not even spoken to Trump about it, saying he was basing his prediction on “newspaper accounts.”\n\n“I wasn’t made secretary of state, so I’m not conducting foreign policy,” Giuliani told BuzzFeed News. “We made that comment in the context of, ‘Will you stop interfering with this guy? He’s got other things to do.’ ”\n\nThe fate of the three Americans has been an important dynamic in the summit preparations. Trump agreed in March to meet Kim without declaring the release of Tony Kim, Kim Dong-chul and Kim Hak-song a prerequisite for the summit. North Korea has called the men “prisoners of war.”\n\nCritics said Trump — who has railed about North Korea’s brutal treatment of another detainee, American college student Otto Warmbier — missed an opportunity to enact an early concession from the Kim regime. Warmbier died this past summer days after being released in a coma following 17 months in captivity after visiting Pyongyang on a tour. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, have sued North Korea in federal court, charging that the regime “brutally tortured and murdered” their son.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who as CIA director made a secret trip last month to meet Kim in Pyongyang, is said to have raised the issue of the detainees with the North Korean leader, and administration officials have said talks to free them are continuing.\n\nForeign policy experts said it is likely the North will release them as a goodwill gesture. However, they cautioned that even if Trump has a guarantee of their release, their physical condition remains unknown and speaking publicly about their fate could make the hostages a more important leverage point for Kim.\n\n“The more public you make it and the more you say something is going to happen that has not happened, it creates leverage for no reason,” said Jung Pak, a former CIA official who now works as an Asia analyst for the Brookings Institution. “It’s not going to get us anything, and it draws criticism that you are politicizing the detainees.”\n\nJoseph Yun, who as the State Department’s former point man on North Korea brought Warm­bier home to Ohio, said Thursday on CNN that administration officials talking about the three Americans publicly could jeopardize efforts to free them.\n\nBut speaking at the National Rifle Association conference in Dallas on Friday, Trump accused the Obama administration of having a general “policy of silence” when it came to North Korea.\n\n“Everybody said, ‘Ohh, don’t talk, please don’t talk,’ ” Trump said. “ ‘Don’t talk! You may make them and him angry! Don’t talk! If a horrible statement is made about the United States, don’t say anything. No comment.’ ”\n\nHe added dismissively: “Please, please, oh my God.”\n\nIn the weeks after Trump agreed to meet Kim, newspapers in Seoul were rife with unsourced reports that the three Americans would be released. The chatter picked up again Wednesday when the Financial Times quoted several South Korean advocates for hostages in the North that the Americans had been moved from labor camps to reeducation facilities in Pyongyang as preparation for their handover to the United States.\n\nU.S. officials said they had no confirmation from Kim’s regime. But the reports ricocheted around social media and were cheered by conservative news sites and Trump supporters as a win for the president.\n\n“BREAKING: North Korea has released all U.S. detainees at the request of President Trump,” Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump, wrote on Twitter to his 430,000 followers. The tweet, which as of Friday afternoon had garnered more than 37,000 retweets and 108,000 “likes,” contained no sourcing.\n\n“When we talk about North Korea, in general, we tend to forget we’re talking about people, and these abductees have families who have been anxiously awaiting their return and are only relying on governments to do that,” said Pak, the former intelligence official. “It would be best to be circumspect in discussions like this. We’re talking about real lives.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/nakamuradavid","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:01:05.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IwG0GEAHveBwYAQLc_A23_H-iWM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VP7AVDSPVMI6RBOBSMTMIUIQGM.jpg","digest":"4HPsGKxTG88q+xFx/wr3xw==\n"}

They will also discuss the U.S. president’s own upcoming summit with the North Korean leader, a statement said.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump expressed a preference for holding the “big event” with Kim in the demilitarized zone or DMZ between the two Koreas, where Moon and Kim met. He also said Singapore was in contention to host what will be the first summit of between a U.S. and a North Korean leader.\n\n“We now have a date and we have a location. We’ll be announcing it soon,” Trump told reporters Friday from the White House South Lawn before departing for Dallas. He’s previously said the summit was planned for May or early June.\n\nA meeting with Kim seemed an outlandish possibility just a few months ago when the two leaders were trading threats and insults over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons. But momentum for diplomacy has built this year as the rival Koreas have patched up ties. In March, Trump unexpectedly accepted an offer of talks from Kim after the North Korean dictator agreed to suspend nuclear and ballistic missile tests and discuss “denuclearization.”\n\nAccording to South Korea, Kim has said he’d be willing to give up his nukes if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and pledges not to attack the North. But his exact demands for relinquishing weapons that his nation spent decades building remains unclear.\n\nTrump said that withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea is “not on the table.” Some 28,500 U.S. forces are based in the allied nation, a military presence that has been preserved to deter North Korea since the war ended in 1953 without a peace treaty.\n\n“Now I have to tell you, at some point into the future, I would like to save the money,” Trump said later as he prepared to board Air Force One. “You know we have 32,000 troops there but I think a lot of great things will happen but troops are not on the table. Absolutely.”\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump has asked the Pentagon to prepare options plans for drawing down American troops. It cited unnamed officials as saying that wasn’t intended to be a bargaining chip with Kim, but did reflect that a prospective peace treaty between the Koreas could diminish the need for U.S. forces in South Korea.\n\nAt the inter-Korean summit last Friday, held on the southern side of the DMZ, Moon and Kim pledged to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons and seek a formal end this year to the Korean conflict where the opposing sides remain technically at war more than six decades after fighting halted with an armistice.\n\nBut for Trump to contemplate withdrawing troops now would be a quixotic move as he enters into negotiations with Kim whose demands and intentions are uncertain. Two weeks ago, shortly before the inter-Korean summit, Moon said that Kim actually wasn’t insisting on a longstanding demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as a precondition for abandoning his nukes.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, who was due to meet his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong in Washington on Friday, called the Times report “utter nonsense.”\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump complained that South Korea does not do enough to financially support the American military commitment. In March, Washington and Seoul began negotiations on how much South Korea should offset the costs of the deployment in the coming years. Under the current agreement that expires at the end of 2018, the South provides about $830 million per year.\n\nBefore Trump meets Kim, Washington is looking for North Korea to address another persistent source of tension between the adversaries: the detention of three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state of activities in the North.\n\nTrump hinted that the release of Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim was in the offing, but again was sparing on the details.\n\n“We’re having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages, and I think you’re going to see very good things. As I said yesterday, stay tuned,” Trump said, referring to an earlier tweet on the issue.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

(1:38)\n\nNEW YORK -- The New York Mets announced Friday they will designate Matt Harvey for assignment, marking an abrupt and stunning end to the tenure of a pitcher who was considered one of baseball's budding stars and the future face of the organization upon his arrival in 2012.\n\nMets general manager Sandy Alderson said the team made the decision after Harvey refused a demotion to the minor leagues to work out his problems. The Mets recently moved Harvey to the bullpen, but he struggled with the transition and allowed five runs in an 11-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves on Thursday at Citi Field.\n\nAlderson, assistant GM John Ricco, manager Mickey Callaway and pitching coach Dave Eiland met with Harvey at 3:15 p.m. ET Friday and asked him to consider an assignment to the minors. They told Harvey to take a few hours to talk to his agent, Scott Boras, and make a decision. But Harvey declined quickly enough for Alderson to make the DFA announcement by 4 p.m.\n\nThe move will be official on Saturday. The Mets now have seven days to either trade Harvey or release him and allow him to find a new team as a free agent.\n\nAlderson said the move marks \"the end of an era.'' Harvey, 29, was the seventh overall pick in the 2010 MLB draft out of the University of North Carolina. He went 9-5 with a 2.27 ERA in 2013, started for the National League in the All-Star Game and was anointed the \"Dark Knight of Gotham.''\n\nBut Harvey's career stalled after Tommy John surgery and thoracic outlet syndrome surgery, and he was at the center of numerous off-field controversies. The latest came earlier this week when the New York Post reported that he was seen partying in Los Angeles during the Mets' West Coast swing.\n\n\"I think we've tried to find some other solution over a fairly long period of time,'' Alderson said. \"This was a long time coming. It's something we tried to address, we struggled with, and we wrestled with over two managerial regimes. The move to the bullpen was dramatic in itself. I think at this point, pragmatism and realism far outweighed other considerations.\n\n\"Matt's gone through two serious and career-threatening injuries, and he made every effort to return to a championship level. Obviously, there were challenges along the way for him and for us. But those challenges were always worth meeting, not just because of his ability. Matt is an appealing, likeable and vulnerable individual. In spite of the issues, I really like Matt. We're going to miss him, in many ways.''\n\nHarvey's velocity peaked at 96 mph in 2015, and he logged a 2-0 record with a 3.04 ERA and 27 strikeouts in 26 2/3 postseason innings when the Mets advanced all the way to the World Series.\n\nBut his velocity gradually declined after thoracic outlet syndrome surgery, and he was registering 92.6 mph on the radar gun this season. The Mets hoped his fastball might tick upward in more limited exposure in the bullpen, but that never happened.\n\nCallaway said he and Eiland were both disappointed that Harvey failed to make more progress this spring. Harvey's struggles were reflected in a 0-2 record, a 7.00 ERA and a 1.56 WHIP in eight appearances as a starter and reliever.\n\n\"It became evident to Dave and myself that him getting to where he needed to be out of the bullpen probably wasn't something that was realistic,'' Callaway said. \"I thought the route that Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee took when they went all the way down to 'A' ball and kind of rebuilt themselves after 60-70 games in the big leagues was probably a more appropriate route to help Matt Harvey the best we could.\n\n\"It's tough for both of us. We feel like we failed Matt Harvey. I think our job is to help every player, and it's not a good feeling when you can't.''\n\nIn a text to ESPN.com, Boras expressed confidence that Harvey can succeed in his road back to becoming an effective big league starter. But Harvey's comeback will have to take place somewhere other than Citi Field.\n\n\"We feel Matt is a starter that needs to work on four pitches,'' Boras said. \"In the bullpen, a pitcher tends to focus on two pitches to get back to the rotation. Thoracic outlet syndrome is difficult, as location of pitches and feel to pitch is the issue.\n\n\"We're very pleased Matt is healthy and with more-than-needed MLB velo. We have a lot of clay to work with to build the starter sculpture.''","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:58:44.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Espn.com"},"urlToImage":"http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0504%2Fr365776_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"hdaLEfZwyfF1XpLaBRemvw==\n"}

Never,” Trump said. “And you have never stopped fighting for our beloved Constitution. Incredible people.”\n\nTrump endorsed a top NRA goal to allow trained teachers to carry concealed weapons and to install more armed security guards in schools. Signs declaring a school as a gun-free zone, Trump argued, were essentially invitations to attackers to “come in and take us.”\n\n“They love their students and they’re not going to let anybody hurt their students. But you have to give them a chance,” Trump said. “In America, we trust the people to be wise and good … that is why in America, we’ve always trusted the people to keep and bear arms.”\n\nThis is the fourth year in a row that Trump has addressed the NRA, which has been a powerful ally from the earliest days of his presidential campaign. The NRA spent more money on behalf of Trump than did any outside group in 2016, deploying its resources for him earlier than in any other presidential cycle.\n\nBut Friday’s speech was his first appearance before NRA members since the Parkland shooting, which created a new wave of momentum for the gun-control movement nationwide led by the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School themselves.\n\n[As host to NRA meeting, Dallas becomes epicenter of the nation’s gun debate]\n\nThe massacre moved Trump to flirt with stricter gun measures that collided with NRA priorities, such as raising the legal age to purchase AR-15s and similar types of rifles to 21 and expanding background checks to guns sold at shows and online. In a meeting with lawmakers, Trump even mocked Republican lawmakers over the power of the gun lobby, telling one GOP senator he was “afraid of the NRA.”\n\nBut Trump quickly backtracked, instead embracing modest gun-related measures such as legislation to improve information sharing for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That bill, known as the Fix NICS Act, was signed into law as part of a government spending measure in March.\n\nTrump gave no indication Friday that his gun agenda would diverge from policies embraced by the NRA. He began his remarks lavishing praise on the crowd and the group’s commitment to the Second Amendment, saying “the people in this hall have never taken our freedom for granted.”\n\n“Your Second Amendment rights are under siege,” Trump told the NRA members, whom he referred to as patriots. “But they will never ever be under siege as long as I’m your president.”\n\nTo bolster his case for arming teachers and adding guards, Trump argued “there is no stronger deterrent for a sick individual than the knowledge that their attack will end their life and end in total failure.” An FBI study of active shootings has found that mass shootings frequently end when the attackers kill themselves.\n\nTrump also denounced European cities with tougher gun laws, invoking the November 2015 massacre in Paris to make a case that “if one employee or just one patron had a gun,” the citywide attack could’ve been stopped.\n\nThough he has made similar comments before — most notably after the June 2016 massacre inside Pulse nightclub in Orlando — several recent high-profile shootings have occurred despite the presence of armed officers in or around the premises.\n\nIn his speech Friday, Trump showed none of the policy flexibility he did earlier this year that had left some gun-control activists and Democratic lawmakers somewhat optimistic that the famously mercurial president could embrace some firearms restrictions.\n\n“Donald Trump has allowed his presidency to be hijacked by gun lobbyists and campaign dollars,” former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in the head during a constituent event in 2011, said in a statement Friday. “As a result, the threats to our kids and our communities remain unaddressed.”\n\nWhile Trump used the speech to firmly embrace the NRA’s agenda, he also treated it like a campaign rally — urging members to vote in the midterm elections, boasting about the improving unemployment numbers, touting the recent tax cuts, criticizing the media and lambasting the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election.\n\n“So we have the best employment numbers we’ve virtually ever had,” he said. “And yet all we hear about is this phony Russia witch hunt. That’s all we hear about, isn’t it?”\n\nTrump invoked his usual red-meat rhetoric on immigration, complaining that the United States has the “worst laws” and vowing to protect the nation’s borders. he called on Congress to change immigration laws that determine who can legally enter the country.\n\n“They’re going to come in based on merit, not based on picking someone out of a bin,” he said of the impact of his proposed policy changes.\n\nTrump said great things were about to happen on North Korea and criticized past administrations for their poor negotiating skills, while mocking John F. Kerry for breaking his leg during a bike ride when he was serving as secretary of state.\n\nTrump also claimed polling data shows his support among African Americans is rising, something he attributed to recent supportive comments from hip-hop artist Kanye West.\n\n“We have great love going on in this country,” he said.\n\nSignaling a new, escalated phase of midterm politics, Trump called out several Senate Democrats up for reelection by name — Bill Nelson (Fla.), Jon Tester (Mont.) and Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.) — and urged the crowd to elect more Republicans.\n\n“Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they’re releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets,” he said.\n\nAttendees of the annual NRA event cheered on the president, who seemed to draw energy from the crowd.\n\nInside the mammoth convention hall next to the arena where Trump delivered his remarks, a group gathered around a screen showing his speech at the Springfield Armory display.\n\nJoe and Connie Henderson of Tucson, applauded throughout. Joe Henderson said he agrees with “90 percent” of what Trump says, particularly on immigration and guns. And Connie Henderson said Trump said exactly what needed to be said on guns.\n\n“I think he’s right on the mark,” she said. “We do need to stand up. We do need to vote more Republican. We do need to get rid of the people who want to get rid of our rights.”\n\nKatie Zezima in Dallas and Mark Berman in Washington contributed to this report.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:56:15.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IwG0GEAHveBwYAQLc_A23_H-iWM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VP7AVDSPVMI6RBOBSMTMIUIQGM.jpg","digest":"XLbiSQMWPxNGi7w7YBN+Ug==\n"}

CNN did not name the doctor in the report, saying anonymity was requested as a condition of getting the memos.\n\nA person familiar with the concerns said Peña was the doctor who delineated those concerns.\n\nJackson, a Navy rear admiral and former combat physician who served in Iraq, came under scrutiny after the office of Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) released a list of allegations about him from more than 20 unnamed current and former work colleagues.\n\nPresident Trump has decried the allegations as “not true” and has attacked Tester, who is up for reelection in November.

Gov. Donna Lynne, who serves as chair on Colorado's Commission on Indian Affairs.\n\nThomas Kanewakeron Gray, 19, and Lloyd Skanahwati Gray, 17, had saved their money to drive from New Mexico to Fort Collins for a campus tour Monday. The brothers had dreamed of attending CSU, according to a Facebook post by their mother, Lorraine Kahnertokwas Gray, this week.\n\nTheir trip was interrupted when a parent called campus police because she was nervous when the two men joined the tour, according to a letter sent out by CSU.\n\nCan't understand the audio below? Read the transcript of the call here.\n\nAfter the university posted the letter on Facebook, it was met with more than 298 comments and counting as of Friday afternoon. Few expressed anything but anger.\n\n► \"I love Colorado State University, but for the first time I'm not proud to be a CSURam,\" wrote CG Byers. \"One individual's prejudice disgraced our university.\"\n\nSome were quick to point out other bias-motivated incidents on CSU’s campus, including the distribution of Nazi propaganda fliers.\n\n► \"I really wish my alma mater would stop embarrassing me,\" said Gayle Robison. \"You allow Nazis to march but can't leave POC (people of color) alone. You probably need to the Nazis in your midst who are directing these gaffes.\"\n\nSome called for action against the parent who called the police and/or their prospective student.\n\n► Eric Dreas wrote: \"Next time pull the person who called police aside and question them FIRST on their complaint. So sad!!\"\n\n► \"The 'scared' mother's child should not be allowed admission to CSU,\" wrote Nathan Ayala. \"She singlehandedly is causing outrage because she is so simpleminded and scared. Colorado State is a welcoming and open university and this is a travesty. I feel sorry for those students from New Mexico and hope they aren't traumatized because one person was scared.\"\n\nOthers questioned their consideration of attending CSU:\n\n► \"I'm a current college student and I was wanting to go to school here but idk,\" said Shaun Michael. \"And I am a Native American. I'm glad I read this cause idk if I wanna be subjected to racism and how the police favors others with out questioning the caller first. That is very unacceptable.\"\n\nSome commenters recommended the brothers attend a different university.\n\n► Laren Nowell wrote: \"Come visit the University of Oklahoma we have a huge presence of Native American students and culture is on full display through out campus!!\"\n\nNot everyone condemned the incident.\n\n► \"I recently did a tour with my daughter and if 2 random people, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, etc., joined the group in the middle of the tour, I could see scenarios where that would make me uncomfortable,\" wrote Tim Lyons. \"It also seems logical that after receiving a call, the police would contact the people who joined the group to insure they were supposed to be in the group.\n\n\"I find it odd that there wasn't more of an effort made to help the men rejoin the group after the group moved on, but maybe they were embarrassed, or angry, and didn't want to rejoin,\" Lyons continued. \"Again, without being there, it's impossible to know all of the circumstances. Just my thoughts.\"\n\n► Nicholas Scott Wells commented that he thought police \"handled it appropriately.\"\n\n\"Someone followed the appropriate channels and there's outrage over it,\" he wrote. \"No one was shot, arrested, stabbed, ect. Maybe the lady DIDN'T call the cops just because the kids were brown. Maybe she did. ... Get over it.\"\n\n► Rob Sprecher, who identified himself as a 40-year police officer, said he has previously \"quickly dismissed complaints from the indignant scaredy-cats I've run into. The University really mishandled this. Shame on you.\"\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Lynne said her office had spoken with CSU President Tony Frank and that \"new procedures will be introduced to better manage campus tours.\"\n\n\"We want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring our public universities are open and welcoming to all students and hope that the young men will not be deterred in their pursuit of attending college in Colorado, a traditional homeland to many tribal nations,\" said Lynne's statement.\n\nIn a comment by CSU on the post just before 11 a.m. Friday, the university said it would refund the brothers' travel expenses.\n\n►\"Update on this week’s tour incident:\n\n\n\n Early this week, University officials reached out directly to the family of the young men and their high school. We’d like the opportunity to speak with Ms. Gray and her sons but we have not heard back from the family. We ask them to please get in touch with us at their convenience. We will refund any expenses they incurred traveling to CSU. We deeply regret the unwelcoming and concerning experience they had while guests on our campus. The Office of Admissions, Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Native American Cultural Center, and CSU Police Department all are reviewing how such an incident can be avoided or handled differently in the future.\"\n\nThe university later released plans for improved campus tour procedures, including giving all tour-goers lanyards at check-in.","author":"Sarah Kyle","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:33:18.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Coloradoan.com"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abf7fc9e077790e137c6a86512b8396963a5a375/c=0-302-3264-2146\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/04/FortCollins/FortCollins/636610328601757496-CSU-facebook.jpg","digest":"L2WeUnRy0rsY6H8SEgEPdg==\n"}

Many decided to stay in Mexico for now.\n\nAfter a month-long, 2,000-mile journey, their arrival at the border was hotly anticipated. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions beefed up legal resources on the border this week to handle people from the caravan.\n\nTrump had urged that the caravan to be detained and repeated his call for stronger border security Monday morning, writing on Twitter, “Our Southern Border is under siege.”\n\nThe Trump administration said on Friday it will end temporary protections on Jan. 5, 2020 for up to 57,000 Honduran immigrants who arrived in the United States in the wake of Hurricane Mitch two decades ago. Temporary protection is different than the asylum status being claimed by members of the caravan.\n\nJust after 9 a.m., the migrants lined up to enter the long passageway between the countries. In single file, they walked straight through, mothers carrying teddy bears in one hand and small children in another.\n\nAmong them was Irma Rivera, 31, with a son in her arms and a daughter prancing ahead.\n\nThey had walked this route yesterday, led to the U.S. gate with a large group of migrants only to be turned back.\n\nAs they reached a bend in the walkway on Friday, the view opened onto American soil and a large U.S. flag.\n\n“Where is the wall? I want to climb Trump’s wall,” said the boy, four years old. His mother laughed, tears glistening. There was no wall in sight, only a chance to join a long-lost brother in Texas and begin a new life.\n\nHer husband, a farmer, was killed late last year in El Salvador by a gang of farmers he had denounced for robbing his land, she said.\n\nIn Mexico outside the port of entry, the remaining migrants were joined in a makeshift camp by other would-be asylum-seekers who had come seeking information and donations.\n\nMeanwhile, the caravan’s organizers scrambled to collect migrants’ names to track their dispersal across U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centers after they exit the port of entry’s detention facility in coming days.","author":"Delphine Schrank","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:06:42.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258588595\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE431MK","digest":"XyPDreVC7WbSUTnSjp6aCw==\n"}

While Harvey was fully within his rights to refuse said assignment, it did in essence mean the end of his Mets career.\n\nThe 29-year-old will not go through waivers and either be traded or released. If he's released, then a team can sign him for the minimum while the Mets would be on the hook for the unpaid balance of his $5.625 million salary for 2018. So where might Harvey land? Before we do the forbidden dance called \"idle speculation,\" let's make a few observations relative to his forthcoming market ...\n\nSo those are all considerations for any team that takes a flyer on Harvey. That said, there's always the chance that Harvey, who for a long time has seemed ill-suited to the media environment in New York, will benefit from a less pressurized environment and of course new coaching methods. Assuming GM Sandy Alderson isn't able to offload his salary via trade, which seems to be a safe assumption, he'll also be available on the cheap. If he pans out with his new team, then perhaps a long-term extension is within the range of possibilities.\n\nWith all that said, let's look at some potential fits in no particular order ....\n\nThey're a bad team with nothing to lose, they need starting pitching, and they're also starved for attention. As well, there's nothing resembling any kind of media glare when it comes to the 2018 Marlins, at least if you're not in the owner's box.\n\nThe O's are presently lugging around a worst-in-baseball rotation ERA of 5.75. While the homer-friendly ways of Camden Yards and the brutal nature of the AL East might not be ideal for Harvey, no team is more desperate for passable rotation innings.\n\nThis is probably a longshot, but the Dodgers at present have Hyun-Jin Ryu and Julio Urias sidelined for the foreseeable future. As well, Rich Hill, Alex Wood, and even Clayton Kershaw have injury histories of varying degrees. If Harvey's willing to accept a somewhat uncertain role as an in-case-of-emergency depth piece, then this is a potential fit.\n\nLongtime Sox pitching coach Don Cooper has a history of fixing broken down vets. Also, the club as it prepares to emerge from a rebuild in 2019 may want to see whether Harvey can turn into some kind of medium-term piece, assuming he merits and is open to an extension.\n\nMaybe Harvey could be part of whatever it is they're doing to fill/paper over/avoid thinking about that fifth rotation spot. This concludes the author's analysis of the Rays' potential interest in Matt Harvey.\n\nA team with interest in Harvey must necessarily be desperate. The Reds, with the NL's worst rotation, may be in need of replacement arms, or at least a sixth guy to take some innings off the younger hurlers.\n\nA change in Seattle? The M's are hellbent on contention this season, but they're lugging around a rotation ERA north of 5.00. Specifically, Mike Leake has struggled badly thus far, and there's very little in the upper rungs of the farm system.\n\nThe Angels have been one of baseball's best teams thus far, but they have four starting pitchers -- Alex Meyer, Matt Shoemaker, JC Ramirez, and Nick Tropeano -- on the DL. As well, Shohei Ohtani's workload is far from certain.\n\nTheir inclusion flows from the premise that it might be time to cut bait on Matt Moore.\n\nIf you Google \"Matt Harvey Yankees, then you get almost 500,000 search results. So here he is. Also, Jordan Montgomery is on the DL, and Sonny Gray seems to have forgotten how to throw strikes.\n\nTo be sure, you'd have more fits if Harvey were willing to accept a bullpen role, but that doesn't appear to be the case, at least right now ...","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T22:43:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Cbssports.com"},"urlToImage":"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2018/04/24/1b493eac-0976-4d25-8eb3-33448c683346/thumbnail/770x433/7e5ae0886f197faa1ebb54a6bd46ee02/matt-harvey.jpg","digest":"LEeX18Jc66McBfZW6CKxng==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aecee020a500bdef43329bf"},"description":"The case is becoming harder to make for the Oracle of Omaha.","title":"Warren Buffett Needs a New Reason to Be Bullish on Stocks","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-04/warren-buffett-needs-a-new-reason-to-be-bullish-on-stocks","text":"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will be holding its annual meeting this weekend. That means Omaha, where Buffett’s investment vehicle and insurance firm is based, will be flooded with investors who hang on every word of the world’s most famous stock picker.\n\nIf asked, Buffett is likley to say, as he almost always does, that stocks will continue to go up. Buffett is perennially positive, which is understandable. As the world’s third-richest person, things have tended to work out for him. But Buffett has typically tried to back up his bullishness. If pressed this year, however, the Oracle of Omaha may have a harder time than usual justifying his rosy crystal ball.\n\nBuffett has typically hung his stock market bullishness, or, in a few rare instances, bearishness, on the ratio that compares the total value of all publicly traded companies with gross domestic product. When the market cap of U.S. stocks collectively equal about 80 percent of GDP, as it did in early 2009, Buffett has said it is time to buy. When the value grows to 130 percent of GDP, as it did in late 2007, it is time to sell. The problem now is that the measure crossed 130 percent in early 2017 (it also reached that threshold in late 2015, before stocks dropped), and the stock market has continued to rise. It is now close to 150 percent, even with the market’s recent wobbles.\n\nSo Buffett should be saying sell, right? Maybe not. There is reason to believe the gauge is not that useful anymore, or at least out of whack. The measure is essentially a giant price-to-sales ratio for the entire market. And companies with higher profit margins tend to have higher price-to-sales ratios. In general, though, corporate profit margins have tended to be higher than average over the past few years. And there is reason to believe, especially now that U.S. tax rates have been cut, that they will stay that way. That might mean Buffett’s favorite stock market gauge should be higher than normal, though how much higher is difficult to say. Not to mention that the largest U.S. companies derive more and more of their sales and growth overseas, so comparing U.S. stock market values with the domestic economy might be less relevant.\n\nLately, Buffett’s case for the stock market has rested on low interest rates. Yes, stocks look expensive, but they can stay elevated as long as interest rates stay low. This year, though, interest rates have risen, and as a result the valuation of stocks, as measured by price-to-earnings ratios, has dropped. Earnings, on the other hand, have risen. The combination means that stocks are basically flat for the year. Nonetheless, investors have seen for the first time the flip side of Buffett’s low-interest-rates-equal-higher-stocks paradigm. Many think interest rates will continue to rise, though yields seem to have leveled out in the past few weeks.\n\nThis could be why Buffett, despite not backing off his bullishness, has tended to bring up the market less and less. In 2012, Buffett dedicated three pages of his annual letter to why he thought investors should buy stocks. This year’s letter contained a warning on volatility and a chart of how much Berkshire’s stock has dropped in the market’s worst periods. Not that Buffett predicted a drop. He was just saying. It appeared as if his enthusiasm was wearing off. If Buffett’s going to continue to tell investors to be bullish, he’s going to need a new reason.","author":"Stephen Gandel","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:02:48.000Z"},"source":{"id":"bloomberg","name":"Bloomberg"},"urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iCB0ZBWEioRs/v1/1200x800.jpg","digest":"14O9SNllpNYo80lg/3g8ew==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aecee070a500bdef43329c3"},"description":"The mutual challenge of managing Pyongyang could offer Washington and Beijing the chance to get along.","title":"Could North Korea Help Bring the United States and China Closer Together?","url":"http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/04/could-north-korea-help-bring-the-united-states-and-china-closer-together/","text":"Could North Korea Help Bring the United States and China Closer Together?\n\nNorth Korea is Asia’s most immediate security threat, but confrontation between China and the United States remains the main long-term risk to regional prosperity and stability. Even as prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea brighten, dark clouds hover over China-U.S. relations.\n\nIn a meeting overlooking Beijing’s Forbidden City, I joined Chinese and U.S. scholars and practitioners last month to reassess growing strategic competition and a looming trade war. Participants on both sides voiced concern that the foundation of the China-U.S. relationship is more fragile than any time since the normalization of relations in 1979.\n\nChinese analysts argue that the United States refuses to accommodate China’s rise, while U.S. observers see China pursuing predatory economic policies and creeping acts of sovereignty. Given sharply different perceptions of each other and the rules for maintaining order, how will China and the United States manage strategic competition in the coming years, under U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping?\n\nIf experts agree on anything, it is that the problems in U.S.-China relations are varied, deepening, and resistant to easy solutions. While a trade war may be averted, tariffs and investment restrictions are unlikely to compel fundamental changes within China’s system of state capitalism. Seventeen years after accession to the World Trade Organization, China is the most closed of all G-20 states and not one of the market economies the World Trade Organization was set up to regulate. The Chinese see pressure as trying to force change on their system and ideology, and many appear to want to do the minimum to placate Washington rather than widen market access. China also knows that it has leverage — it holds 20 percent of U.S. foreign debt and could threaten not to absorb an additional $70 billion per year as economic frictions intensify.\n\nGeopolitical flashpoints are as intractable as economic ones. Chinese assail the nonbinding Taiwan Travel Act, which “encourages visits between officials of the United States and Taiwan at all levels,” as threatening Beijing’s core interests and the longstanding “One China” policy. Disputes in the South and East China Seas simmer but could flare up quickly. China is determined to assert historical claims that in some cases exceed rights under international law. For instance, in a deliberate attempt to intimidate foreign navies to abide by Chinese policies, the Chinese Navy in April confronted three Australian ships sailing to Vietnam.\n\nWith both trade and geopolitical hotspots eroding bilateral relations, Chinese and U.S. interlocutors are asking similar questions of each other. From Beijing’s perspective, will the United States impede China’s path to achieving a great rejuvenation by 2049? From Washington’s vantage point, is China determined to revise the liberal postwar order?\n\nNone of these challenges is about to disappear. But one issue could help bring the United States and China together. The security litmus test for China-U.S. relations is the question of how to manage North Korea. At least in this instance, there is a chance to transform a significant defense challenge into a peaceful diplomatic process.\n\nJust as Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have been careful to work together on a pressure-and-engagement strategy, so too must Xi stick to the same strategic course, even as summits create a buoyant atmosphere. China needs to remain skeptically engaged, rather than succumb to the temptation to relieve pressure on Pyongyang just for beginning talks and making bold statements. The United States needs to stay outcome-focused, seeking steps toward complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.\n\nSome in China are supremely confident that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will give up his nuclear weapons. But before we leap to the conclusion that this time will be different, experience should temper expectations. Major-power détente in 1972 catalyzed the first high-level North-South talks since the Korean Armistice Agreement, but they soon foundered. Likewise, the end of the Cold War prompted North Korea to sign historic agreements in 1991 and 1992, just before the first nuclear crisis gripped the Korean Peninsula.\n\nChinese might remember how North Korea has changed its view of Beijing with little notice. For example, three years after praising China’s first nuclear test and six years after signing a treaty of alliance, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung decried China’s big-power chauvinism and expressed fear of Han nationalism. Similarly, shortly after Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping took Kim Il Sung to Sichuan in 1982 to learn about peaceful Chinese reforms, the Kim family attempted to assassinate South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan in Myanmar.\n\nIf China has good reason not to trust North Korea, the United States and South Korea have ample evidence to insist on actions and not mere words. These three and other countries are testing Kim’s intentions — a lengthy but embryonic examination.\n\nKim’s recent rhetoric suggests he wants successful first summits with Presidents Moon and Trump. By acceding to essential preconditions and dropping unacceptable demands — announcing a freeze on nuclear weapons testing and giving up the idea that denuclearization would require the removal of all U.S. troops on the Korean Peninsula — Kim is outlining the script of probable outcomes for these initial top-level encounters. Moon and Kim may announce a peace process, and Trump and Kim may codify a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests as the first step toward denuclearization.\n\nBut implementation has always been the hard part of dealing with North Korea. Even a successful process will take time. Many questions will remain after the leaders climb down from the summit, including: the precise scope of denuclearization, how to preserve North Korea’s entitlement to civil nuclear power (including uranium enrichment), the timetable for when specific actions must be taken, the verification means for stopping the production of fissile material, how to safeguard against cheating (such as hiding warheads and mobile missiles), what to do about space launches, and what quid pro quos to offer North Korea in exchange for these steps.\n\nThe North Korean challenge, in other words, will get harder, not easier, after a pair of summit meetings with Kim. Not only must Seoul and Washington remain committed to pressure and engagement, but so too must Beijing. There is a distinct opportunity for dealing with North Korea, but only if pressure can be maintained all the way through the process of talks.\n\nWith ominous clouds accumulating over the U.S.-China relationship, the mutual challenge of managing the North Korea problem offers a rare ray of sunshine. No single issue can prevent strategic competition between China and the United States. But pragmatic cooperation on such a vital and longstanding security challenge as the North Korea problem would go a long way to adding ballast to the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century.","author":"Patrick M.

This person has immediately been let go from the Yeezy brand.” In a follow-up tweet, he wrote: “In a moment of inspiration, energy and excitement I had posted this sketch and would like to acknowledge the true creator of this amazing work, Tony Spackman.”\n\nIt all started when West tweeted the sketch on April 30 with the caption, “This is where a YEEZY study for base layer starts. I’m so excited about our new design team. Yeezy is no longer a fashion company we should be referred to as apparel or clothing or simply YEEZY.”\n\nRELATED: Adidas CEO Says Company Has Not Discussed Dropping Kanye West After His Controversial Slavery Comments\n\nWest’s tweet caught the attention of Spackman who posted on his Instagram Stories a comparison of his sketches and West’s which appeared to be identical.\n\n“When Kanye rips your 10-year-old Nike sketch and claims it,” he stated on Instagram Stories adding that West had photoshopped out the title and the date.\n\nSpackman later clarified that the image, which remains on his website, is actually 13 years old which was “Unlucky for some.”\n\nSpackman’s design was from 2005 for a Nike collection called “Nike React,” a running collection grounded in freedom of movement and human comfort, according to Diet Prada, an Instagram account that keeps track of brands “knocking each other off.”\n\nLooking for more style content?

I have to put the ‘ed’ on it for the stockholders. When I was young I used to sketch the Swoosh and everything. It was heartbreaking for me to have to leave Nike,” West recently said in his wide-ranging interview with Charlamagne Tha God of iHeartRadio’s The Breakfast Club.\n\nHe said the reason he left Nike for Adidas was that of the royalties and “[Nike] wouldn’t let me build anything,” adding, “Everyone who worked with me are now the hottest people at Nike.”\n\nWATCH: Kim Kardashian West Is ‘Absolutely Worried’ About Kanye But Will ‘Defend Him to the End’: Source\n\nWhile West has been teasing new collections for Yeezy, as well as new music, multiple sources recently told PEOPLE that he will get so excited about his latest projects that he sometimes forgets to respect other people’s boundaries.\n\n“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen him like this,” a friend of West said. “He’s all over the place. Excited. Loud. He’s sleeping very little, texting at all hours of the day or night. Coming up with ideas, sending them to people and instructing everyone to drop everything and collaborate. He truly feels like it’s the most exciting stuff in the world.”\n\n“It’s like he has discovered a cure for cancer. He’s that excited.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aed140f0a500bdef4332a34"},"description":"Whether or not the autonomous Pacifica minivan was at fault, it's bad news for a young industry trying to prove it can makes roads safer for everyone.","title":"Waymo's Self-Driving Crash in Arizona Revives Tough Questions","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-crash-self-driving-google-arizona/","text":"A self-driving Waymo minivan crashed in Chandler, Arizona, this afternoon, resurrecting tough questions about the safety of autonomous technology and ripping the barely-crusted scab off the technology’s reputation, which was badly wounded when an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in the same state just seven weeks ago.\n\nChandler police report only minor injuries. According to a police statement, a Honda sedan traveling eastbound through an intersection swerved into the Waymo Chrysler Pacifica’s westbound lane to avoid hitting another car traveling north. (It’s unclear at this time who had the light and who is at fault.) The Honda hit the Waymo vehicle on its side, injuring the female safety driver behind the wheel of the SUV. Police say the vehicle was in autonomous mode when the incident occurred and was not traveling above the 45 mph speed limit. Waymo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPhotos from local news stations show the Waymo vehicle pushed up against the sidewalk, with extensive damage to its front left bumper and wheel. The Honda’s entire front has been smashed in, along with its front passenger door. Its airbags appear to have deployed.\n\nVideo footage from the Waymo car’s cameras will help determine what happened, but based on preliminary evidence, the police say Waymo was not at fault. “The vehicle was at the wrong place at the wrong time,” says Seth Tyler, a spokesperson for the Chandler Police Department. “Waymo and the driver of the vehicle won’t get cited for anything because she didn't do anything wrong.” (Still, it’s early. In the hours after a self-driving Uber SUV killed Elaine Herzberg in nearby Tempe, police told reporters the crash may have been unavoidable. But video footage released a week later showed the opposite: The SUV's safety driver was not looking at the road in the moments prior to the crash, and autonomous vehicle experts say Uber’s tech should have picked up pedestrian with enough time to hit the brakes or swerve out of the way.\n\nAfter that crash, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said his team’s technology would have done better. “We're very confident that our car could have handled that situation,” he told Forbes. “We know that for a lot of different reasons. It's what we have designed this system to do in situations just like that.”\n\nIn February, Waymo announced its cars have driven 5 million miles on public roads since its beginnings as the Google Self Driving program in 2009. Crash reports (which companies developing autonomous tech must make public in California) show Waymo cars have been involved in upward of 30 minor crashes but have caused just one: In 2016, a Lexus SUV in autonomous mode changed lanes into the path of a public bus. The SUV sustained minor damage, and no one was hurt. The numbers for humans are hard to pin down, but researchers at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute estimate people crash 4.2 times per million miles. That would be 21 crashes over 5 million miles, roughly matching Waymo’s record.\n\nThe company has been running tests without safety drivers in Chandler and plans to launch a driverless taxi service sometime this year. Waymo (and other self-driving car companies) love Arizona for its sunny, sensor-friendly weather and its regulation-free approach to the emergent autonomous tech. (Governor Doug Ducey did, however, suspend Uber’s testing following March’s death.) Waymo is also testing AVs in northern California and Atlanta.\n\nEven if the Waymo minivan isn't at fault here, the company can’t be happy about the timing. After the Uber crash (and the death of a man using Tesla’s semiautonomous Autopilot feature a week later), unsettling questions return to the surface: How do we know these systems are ready for service? Should they really be testing on public streets? Is keeping a human overseer behind the wheel an adequate backup? And aren’t these cars supposed to make everybody safer?\n\n“The images simplify the story and look like terrible accidents,” says Bart Selman, an artificial intelligence expert at Cornell University. “Lots of mistakes are made by human drivers. We have gotten used to that and don’t even report that anymore.”\n\nIndeed, in 2016, human drivers in Arizona averaged nearly 350 crashes and two deaths a day. That’s why the promoters of autonomous technology harp on the facts that nearly 40,000 people die on US roads every year, and that human error causes more than 90 percent of crashes. Letting robots—which don’t get drunk, distracted, sleepy, or ragey—take the wheel could put a serious dent in those figures.\n\nIt will take time. Time to improve the technology, to test and deploy and make it widespread. Road deaths will never reach zero, and it will take decades to get anywhere near that level. In the meantime, the people trying to get there will have to keep at their work—and get ready to answer some unpleasant questions yet again.","author":"WIRED Staff","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T22:46:58.000Z"},"source":{"id":"wired","name":"Wired"},"urlToImage":"https://media.wired.com/photos/5aecd6e441f2a64a30dd4652/191:100/pass/Waymo-Crash.jpg","digest":"d2Da7vEb38XX7WUzXx5+6Q==\n"}

The same court in December 2016 had reinstated Skakel’s conviction after a lower court ordered a new trial, citing mistakes by the trial attorney, Mickey Sherman.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear if prosecutors will subject Skakel to a new trial. A spokesman for Chief State’s Attorney Kevin Kane said prosecutors were reviewing the new ruling. He declined further comment.\n\nSkakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy’s widow, Ethel Kennedy, was convicted of murder in 2002 in the death of Martha Moxley in 1975 when they were teenagers. He was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison, but was freed on $1.2 million bail after serving 11 years behind bars when the lower court overturned his murder conviction in 2013.\n\nThe case has drawn international attention because of the Kennedy name, Skakel’s rich family, numerous theories about who killed Moxley and the brutal way in which she died. Several other people, including Skakel’s brother Tommy Skakel, have been mentioned as possible killers.\n\nThe slaying took place in the exclusive Bell Haven section of Greenwich where Martha and Skakel were neighbors. At trial, prosecutors said Skakel was angry with Martha because she had spurned his advances while having a sexual liaison with his brother Tommy.\n\nSkakel’s appellate lawyer, Hubert Santos, had asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its 2016 ruling, resulting in Friday’s decision.\n\n“We’re elated that our argument was vindicated,” Santos said Friday. “It was a good decision because it was spot on the law.”\n\nSantos argued that Sherman made poor decisions, including not focusing on Skakel’s brother as a possible suspect and failing to attempt to contact an alibi witness. Santos said Skakel was several miles away from the crime scene on Oct. 30, 1975 watching a Monty Python movie with friends when Moxley was bludgeoned with a golf club.\n\nSantos also has said there was no physical evidence or eyewitnesses linking Skakel to the killing.\n\nSherman has defended his work, and state prosecutors have argued he did an adequate job. The Associated Press left a message with him Friday seeking comment on the ruling.\n\nConservative Justice Peter Zarella wrote the majority opinion when the highly divided Supreme Court reinstated Skakel’s conviction in a 4-3 ruling in December 2016. Zarella left the court at the end of 2016 to return to private practice.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled Friday, the panel included the same justices that ruled in 2016 — minus Zarella. It included Justice Gregory D’Auria, a former lawyer in the state attorney general’s office named to the court last year. D’Auria was in the majority decision Friday.\n\nThe high court’s reversal of a previous ruling is highly unusual, legal observers said.\n\nWriting for the majority Friday, Justice Richard Palmer said Skakel was prejudiced in the case by Sherman’s failure to obtain alibi testimony from witness Denis Ossorio.\n\n“Without Ossorio’s testimony, the state was able to attack the petitioner’s (Skakel’s) alibi — a complete alibi for the time period during which it is highly likely that the victim was murdered — as part of a Skakel family conspiracy to cover up the petitioner’s involvement in the victim’s murder,” Palmer wrote.\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Dennis Eveleigh noted that the exact time of the killing was never established and a medical examiner’s report concluded it likely happened sometime between 9:30 p.m. and 4:30 or 5:30 the next morning.\n\n“I believe that the majority fails to consider the well-established rule that, as a matter of law, an alibi defense is no defense at all when it is reasonably possible that the crime was committed outside of the alibi period. That is certainly the case here,” Eveleigh wrote.\n\nMoxley’s brother, John Moxley, told the AP that he was disappointed with the ruling and that it was too soon to say what the family would want next in the case.\n\n“I don’t know what the next steps are. My mom is getting older. I just don’t think she has the strength to go on with this,” said Moxley, 59.\n\nHe said he would not trade places with Skakel for anything.\n\n“He’ll be in jail for the rest of his life,” Moxley said. “He may not be physically in jail. He may be walking the streets, but he’ll be in hell at some point.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Melia contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Navy photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Carla Giglio\n\nGrowing tensions with Russia have led NATO and its members to make a number of changes to their military posture on the ground in Europe, and now the US is reactivating its Second Fleet to oversee the northern Atlantic Ocean and US East Coast.\n\nThe Second Fleet was deactivated in September 2011 after 65 years of service as part of a cost-saving and organizational-restructuring effort; many of its personnel and responsibilities were folded into US Fleet Forces Command. The announcement of its reactivation came during the change-of-command ceremony for US Fleet Forces Command, to which the Second Fleet commander will now report.\n\nSecond Fleet's return is part of a shift by the US toward preparing for potential great-power conflict — and to counter Russia in particular.\n\n\"Our National Defense Strategy makes clear that we're back in an era of great-power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex,\" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of US Naval Operations, said on Friday.\n\n\"Second Fleet will exercise operational and administrative authorities over assigned ships, aircraft and landing forces on the East Coast and northern Atlantic Ocean,\" Richardson said. It will also plan and conduct maritime, joint, and combined operations and train, certify, and provide maritime forces in response events around the world.\n\nFrench sailors watch the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush as it transits alongside the French navy frigate Forbin, October 25, 2017. US Navy/Mass Comm. Specialist 3rd Class Matt Matlage\n\nThe fleet will be activated on July 1 and initially be staffed by 11 officers and four enlisted personnel, eventually growing to 85 officers, 164 enlisted personnel, and seven civilians, according to a memo announcing the change obtained by US Naval Institute News.\n\nIssues such as the rank of the commander and relationship with joint commandant commands remain to be decided.\n\nAlso unclear is the future of Fourth Fleet, which is the naval branch of US Southern Command set up in 2008, largely to host Coast Guard law-enforcement detachments. Prior to 2008, the Second Fleet was responsible for operations in Central and South American waters.\n\nPrior to the 2014 seizure of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine by Russian forces, Navy forces on the US side of the Atlantic Ocean were mainly focused on humanitarian and disaster relief missions as well as drug interdiction.\n\nBut Russian naval activity has increased considerably in recent years, with several NATO officials describing it as being at the highest levels since the Cold War. (Though Cold War-era intelligence reports indicate that activity is still far short of Cold War peaks.)\n\nRussia's navy is also smaller than it was during the Cold War, but Moscow has pursued ambitious modernization efforts, focusing primarily on the Black Sea and Northern fleets. The latter force, based in and around the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic, represents a significant military force a short distance from NATO territory in Norway and contains Russia's sea-based nuclear forces.\n\nA Russian navy vessel sails the Neva River during the naval parade for Russia's Navy Day in St. Petersburg, July 2017. Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press\n\nIn 2016, US Navy Adm. James Foggo III, who is now chief of Naval Forces Europe, described tensions between Russia and the US as the \"fourth battle of the Atlantic,\" following the surface and submarine battles of World War I, World War II, and the Cold War.\n\n\"Once again, an effective, skilled, and technologically advanced Russian submarine force is challenging us,\" he said. \"Russian submarines are prowling the Atlantic, testing our defenses, confronting our command of the seas, and preparing the complex underwater battlespace to give them an edge in any future conflict.\"\n\nThe US Navy has increased its patrols in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic, and the Arctic. US Navy ships have also been more active in the Black Sea to \"desensitize Russia\" to a US military presence there. US and Russian ships have also operated in close quarters in the eastern Mediterranean, where Russian forces are assisting the Bashar Assad regime in the Syrian civil war.\n\nUS sailors from Virginia-class attack sub USS California load an MK-48 inert training torpedo at Naval Station Rota, Spain, January 13, 2017.

In the event of conflict with Russia, it be responsible for keeping sea lanes open for US reinforcements heading to Europe.","author":"Christopher Woody","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T22:39:02.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/589354ec3149a13e088b4834-640-320.jpg","digest":"e+VpnEzO9iKjb3PFWM9HRg==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aed19aa0a500bdef4332a66"},"description":"How did Matt Harvey go from being viewed as the Mets' savior to being designated for assignment less than six years after his rapid ascent? More than anything that happened off the field, his arm failed him.","title":"Matt Harvey's Quick and Agonizing Decline With the Mets Is No Mystery","url":"https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/05/04/mets-matt-harvey-designated-for-assignment","text":"The divorce between Matt Harvey and New York was inevitable, probably since August of 2013, when his elbow blew out. It was too much for Harvey to be The Dark Knight again, to live up to the superhero persona he created with the kind of power pitching that recalled his boyhood idol, Roger Clemens, and his contemporary template, Justin Verlander.\n\nThe truth is, for all the times he wound up in the tabloids other than the sports section, Harvey failed because his arm failed him. This is a baseball story. His arm likely failed him because of how he threw a baseball. And when his arm failed him, he knew no other way. He couldn’t pitch without an A-plus fastball, he couldn’t embrace using a bullpen role as a way back, and he couldn’t believe in himself again.\n\nIt is not a mystery. This is what happened to Matt Harvey:\n\nAt age 29, he is in indisputable, steady decline. The Mets cut Harvey because his once-fearsome fastball became the almost exact definition of a mediocre fastball (MLB averages: 92.7 mph, 2,261 rpm). Because he couldn’t find another way to get hitters out, because he could not change his mechanics and because he could not buy into the bullpen, the Mets could not keep sending out to the mound as a starter.\n\nThe decline in his stuff was obvious. And there was no way his fastball was coming back with the way he throws.\n\nHarvey pulls the ball far behind him—crossing the airspace over the rubber, a strenuous maneuver that rarely leads to long careers.\n\n“My dad taught me,” Harvey once told me about his signature arm swing, referring to Ed Harvey, a well-regarded high school baseball coach in Connecticut. “He said bring it down, show it to second base and then go.”\n\nThe pushback arm swing, the “showing” of the ball to second base, and the way he raised the ball high and far from his head helped Harvey gain velocity, but over time those maneuvers also strained his arm. I wrote just the other day that Harvey’s “forearm flyout” way of throwing would not allow him to regain his good fastball.\n\nThe Mets knew this, especially with Mickey Callaway, as informed a modern pitching mind as you can find, as their manager.\n\nThere was a time last season that the Mets’ top baseball executives and staff huddled to decide what to do about Harvey and his five-something ERA. They saw a fragile pitcher.\n\n“He’ll throw on the side, the coaches will come in and say, ‘Man, that’s the best stuff we’ve seen from Harvey in a year,’” said one former Mets staffer. “‘The ball’s coming out of his hand great.’ Then you’d see Harvey and he’d go, ‘My bullpen was unbelievable.’\n\n“But then, the very first inning he runs into trouble, the game is over. You were holding your breath every start because if he had any issues, he’s done. He had zero confidence. His velocity was down. Without it, he was aiming the ball as badly as you could.”\n\nSomeone at the meeting came up with an idea.\n\n“He hasn’t won a game in two months,” the staffer said. “He’s teetering every inning. Why not put him in the bullpen? Let him just come into a game and just let it loose. His velocity may play up. He might build confidence off such a role.”\n\nBut the Mets knew such a move would not be easy. They worried about how it would play out, both in Harvey’s mind and in public. He was Matt Harvey, the Dark Knight, The New Franchise Arm, the pitcher who turned game day at Citi Field into a holiday—Harvey Day. There would be no other way to see it than as a demotion.\n\nThe Mets could have cut him after last season, but they couldn’t bear the thought of Harvey bouncing back somewhere else. Winter reports of his throwing program—here we go again—was that “the ball was coming out of his hand great.” They signed him for $5.625 million, his last year before free agency.\n\nAnd then once the games started, his fastball grew worse. His confidence eroded some more. When the Mets gave him the life preserver of a bullpen role, he threw it away. He snapped profanely at reporters. He gave up seven runs and 12 runners in six innings out of the pen.\n\nThe decline happened quickly, but not nearly as fast as his rise. Harvey was a happening. He bullied people with his fastball and he knew it. When I profiled him for SI, I gave him The Dark Knight nickname, because I saw in Harvey someone who not only had the stuff to save the Mets in Gotham—they were in the middle of six straight losing seasons when Harvey arrived—but also the desire to play the role. He embraced not just being a staff ace but also a dominating personality.\n\n• FROM THE VAULT: Matt Harvey, the Dark Knight of Gotham\n\n“I was born with the edgy fire of wanting to win, and wanting to be the best,” he told me. “I was never going to settle for anything other than that.”\n\nA touted high school pitcher, Harvey dropped to the third round of the draft, picked by the Angels, after not flashing elite velocity as a senior. The Angels offered him a million dollars. Harvey said he wouldn’t sign unless they gave him $2 million, and not a penny less. He wanted enough money so that after taxes, commissions and a brand new car, he could put $1 million in the bank. Ed was pacing in the backyard as the midnight deadline neared. The Angels didn’t call back.\n\nThe episode made Harvey bitter about the business of baseball. He vowed not to forget what he perceived to be the slights of his draft position and the Angels’ offer. He told me someday when he hits free agency, “What happened when I was 18 will be in the back of my mind.”\n\nSuddenly, by getting cut now, he will be a free agent earlier than expected, and with little value to exact his revenge.\n\nHarvey attended North Carolina, where he was supposed to pitch with Rick Porcello and Madison Bumgarner, but those high school pitchers signed as first-round picks of the Tigers and Giants, respectively. Harvey pitched well his freshman year, but as a sophomore, hoping to win a national championship and turn himself into a top-five pick, he regressed. He gained weight, lost velocity and pitched poorly.\n\n“All those added pressures, I let it get to me,” he admitted.\n\nHe bounced back so well as a junior that the Mets took him with the seventh overall pick in 2010. Within two years he was in the big leagues. His debut was spectacular. He became only the sixth pitcher ever to strike out 11 batters and not allow a run in his first major league game. Nobody has done it since. This is where you must remember the greatness of Harvey, because it has faded like an old photograph. He made 36 starts before he first hurt his arm. Take a look at his career to that point in historical terms:\n\nThe list is filled with both brilliance and sadness. The blessing of a power arm at a young age is a curse when it comes to longevity. All those strikeouts, all those pitches, all those forearm flyouts took their toll. Over the past 10 years, only two pitchers threw more than 120 pitches more than once in their first 36 starts: Harvey and Darvish.\n\nHarvey made it back in 2015, throwing more innings after Tommy John surgery than anybody in recent memory. It ended with what now is the quintessential Matt Harvey/Dark Knight moment—running to the mound to start the ninth inning of World Series Game 5, holding a 2–0 lead, 216 innings deep into his post-Tommy John season and sitting on 101 pitches. Manager Terry Collins admitted he listened more to his heart than his head in sending him out.\n\nI was in the booth for Fox that night, and I said as Harvey took the mound he should not throw another pitch out of the stretch—should a runner get on base, Collins needed a fresh arm. Asking Harvey to pitch with the bases empty and a two-run lead was one thing. Asking him to work out of the stretch facing the tying run was too big an ask.\n\nYou know what happened. Lorenzo Cain bled more gas from his tank not just with a walk but also one that required seven pitches. Collins didn’t move as Eric Hosmer came to bat. Cain stole second on the first pitch. Hosmer, his former teammate in travel ball when they were high school kids, ripped the next one for a double.\n\nThere would be no superhero ending. Gotham was not saved. And nothing would be the same again. And now that era is over—the braggadocio, the big fastball, the Escalade he bought because as a kid he would watch the Yankees climb into their big SUVs in the Yankee Stadium player parking lot, the gossip items, the Dark Knight logo in his locker, all those nights when Citi Field rocked simply upon the sight of Harvey walking out to the mound like he owned the joint … and, in his own way, he did.\n\nThis, though, is not a eulogy for his career. Harvey is still only 29 and, in time, may see getting out of New York and out from under his own long shadow as the opportunity he needs. Harvey will have to change. He will have to change the way he throws a baseball, as well as the pitches he throws and maybe even his role.\n\nCorey Kluber was dead-ended in the minors until one day he learned how to throw a two-seam fastball. Rich Hill went to indy ball to learn how to throw more curveballs and in various shapes, parlaying his re-invention into $73 million worth of contracts. Charlie Morton changed his delivery and pitch selection, and closed the seventh game of the World Series. Jake Arrieta was the worst starting pitcher in Orioles history, changed the way he threw a baseball, and won a Cy Young Award.\n\nThere is another chapter for Matt Harvey. Reinvention is hard work, and Harvey, who spit on a million dollars as a teenager, may rise to this challenge. The crowds may never be as loud again as they were on Harvey Days, the fastball might never hop again the way it once did and the champagne life of an A-list celebrity may never again be so bubbly. But now, done with the Mets and the Mets done with him, another, if quieter act is at least possible.","author":"Tom Verducci","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T01:51:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Si.com"},"urlToImage":"https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/05/04/matt-harvey-designated-for-assignment-mets_0.jpg\u0026w=1200\u0026h=628\u0026c=sc\u0026poi=face\u0026q=85","digest":"HaHFqdtH1Yw84Fd4dEYQ4A==\n"}

Legal experts say","title":"A federal judge in Manafort's case just made a bizarre comment about Mueller that left experts baffled","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/legal-experts-react-to-judge-comments-manafort-flip-2018-5","text":"US District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III, who is overseeing one of the federal criminal cases against President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, made an unusual comment Friday that confounded legal experts.\n\nDuring a hearing in which Manafort was seeking the dismissal of one of the two indictments against him in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling, Ellis speculated that prosecutors had charged him to get him to flip against Trump.\n\nManafort is the subject of two indictments from Mueller.\n\nThe first, brought in Washington, DC, accuses Manafort of money laundering, failure to register as a foreign agent, and making false statements to investigators. The other, brought in Virginia, charges him with tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to report foreign bank accounts. Both indictments center largely around Manafort's lobbying work for the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian interests.\n\nManafort's lawyers argued Friday for the dismissal of the Virginia indictment, saying that the charges should be tossed out because they do not relate specifically to the Russia investigation and the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the 2016 presidential race in Trump's favor.\n\nEllis appeared receptive, at least in part, to the argument.\n\n\"I don't see what relation this indictment has with what the special counsel is authorized to investigate,\" Ellis told prosecutors working for Mueller. \"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud. ... What you really care about is what information Mr. Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment.\"\n\nEllis later quipped: \"The vernacular is 'to sing.'\"\n\nLegal experts and former Justice Department prosecutors immediately raised questions about Ellis's comments.\n\n\"The operative question here is whether Manafort committed the crimes he's accused of and whether Mueller had the authority to charge them,\" said Jeffrey Cramer, a longtime former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department. \"Whether prosecutors brought the case to flip Manafort is entirely irrelevant.\"\n\nCramer added, moreover, that it's \"hardly shocking\" when prosecutors charge defendants to gain their cooperation against bigger fish.\n\n\"This is happening in every court room across the country right now, in cases ranging from drug conspiracies to fraud to organized crime,\" he said. \"And appropriately so, otherwise those who make the big decisions get away with it, while lower-level people serve time in jail.\"\n\nAlex Whiting, a former federal prosecutor from Boston and Washington, DC, said as much.\n\n\"It is well-established that it is beyond a judge's authority to inquire into, or second-guess, a prosecutor's exercise of charging discretion unless there is some evidence that the prosecutor based the decision on improper factors,\" Whiting said.\n\nEchoing Cramer's view that prosecutors build cases all the time against powerful figures by prosecuting lower-level actors who then cooperate, Whiting said \"most people would agree that's what we want prosecutors to do: focus their work on higher-level criminal actors.\"\n\nHe added that he does not expect Ellis to use Mueller's motivation in bringing charges as the basis of any decision he makes, but that if he does, \"he will be reversed.\"\n\nExperts also pointed out that Mueller did what any other prosecutor would have done during the course of an investigation.\n\nMueller was appointed by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein. He is tasked with investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the 2016 race in his favor and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired James Comey as FBI director last May.\n\n\"When Mueller came across Manafort's illicit activities, he had two choices,\" Cramer said. \"He could ignore that, or he could bring charges.\"\n\nHe added: \"These prosecutors have the documents. This was a scathing indictment, and they've got Manafort cold.

While much of the document was redacted, Rosenstein authorized Mueller to investigate at least two threads related to Manafort: allegations that he colluded with Russian officials during the campaign, and allegations that he committed crimes \"arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.\"","author":"Sonam Sheth","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:16:46.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ab4732de082e52e008b459c-640-320.jpg","digest":"NNq4NHmbaJGTRld8rm2Iiw==\n"}

Stocks in Shanghai ended 0.5 percent lower while they fell 1.3 percent in Hong Kong.\n\nTrump told reporters in Washington that he was determined to bring fairness to U.S.-China trade.\n\n“We will be doing something one way or the other with respect to what’s happening in China,” Trump said. He added that he had “great respect” for China’s President Xi Jinping. “That’s why we’re being so nice, because we have a great relationship.”\n\nChina during the meetings asked that the United States ease crushing sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nWashington’s demand for a $200 billion cut from China’s U.S. goods trade surplus doubles Trump’s previous request for a $100 billion cut. China had a record U.S. goods trade surplus of $375 billion in 2017.\n\nTrump has also demanded “reciprocity” between U.S. and Chinese tariffs, frequently complaining about China’s 25 percent car tariff while the U.S. equivalent is 2.5 percent.\n\nThe U.S. team, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, demanded that China lower tariffs to levels no higher than those imposed by the United States, two people familiar with the demands said. The delegation also asked China to halt subsidies for advanced technology linked to its “Made in China 2025,” the sources said.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute are U.S. allegations that Chinese joint venture requirements and other policies force American companies to turn over their intellectual property, costing them billions of dollars annually and giving China’s state enterprises an edge in the race to develop new industries crucial to future growth.\n\nChina denies such coercion. Its 2025 industrial plan seeks to upgrade China’s manufacturing sector to more advanced products, including information technology, semiconductors and aircraft.\n\n“I think the U.S. is asking for the impossible. Reducing the deficit by $200 billion by 2020 is quite an unrealistic demand, but it may also be a negotiation tactic to start high first,” said Tommy Xie, economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.\n\nChina offered to increase U.S. imports and lower tariffs on some goods, including cars, according to the sources. But Beijing asked the United States to treat Chinese investment equally under national security reviews, refrain from new restrictions on investments and halt a proposal to impose 25 percent tariffs under its “Section 301” intellectual property probe.\n\nChina also offered to reconsider anti-dumping duties on U.S. sorghum, according to a proposal it submitted.\n\nXinhua said there had been exchanges of opinion on intellectual property protections, expanding U.S. exports and bilateral services trade. It gave no indication of what actions might be taken but said the two sides committed to resolve their trade disputes through dialogue.\n\nU.S. negotiators agreed to bring up the ZTE sanctions with Trump after new representations from the Chinese side, Xinhua said. ZTE was hit last month with a seven-year ban on American companies’ selling components and software to it after the U.S. Commerce Department found ZTE failed to comply with an agreement to settle breached U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\n“My impression was that (the talks) didn’t go well given the rhetoric,” said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital markets in Hong Kong. “I think the divide is still very big.”\n\nIn an editorial on its website, widely read Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times cited people close to the talks as saying the Chinese “hit back hard” at U.S. criticism, letting them know that China would not give in.\n\nThe United States has proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods under its “Section 301” probe. Those could go into effect in June following the completion of a 60-day consultation period, but activation plans have been kept vague.\n\nChina has said its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including soybeans and aircraft, will go into effect if the U.S. duties are imposed.","author":"David Lawder","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T09:46:21.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258371128\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE4302J","digest":"/e5xLkIQU5f1R2+mqFTeRw==\n"}

Here's how he got there.","title":"Albert Pujols' 3000 hits, by the numbers","url":"http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23366780/a-statistical-look-los-angeles-angels-slugger-albert-pujols-historic-3000th-hit","text":"With Albert Pujols becoming the fourth player to reach 3,000 hits and 600 home runs, check out the highlights of his career told by Tim Kurkjian. (1:55)\n\nThe 3,000-hit club is already one of the more exclusive fraternities in baseball. But after Albert Pujols collected No. 3,000 on Friday, the number of players who have reached the milestone the way that he has can be counted on one of his powerful hands.\n\nThe 38-year-old Pujols is one of just four players to collect 600 homers and 3,000 hits, joining Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Alex Rodriguez. A 10-time All-Star who ranks first in WAR among active players, Pujols gets plenty of bang for the buck: Over 40 percent of his hits have been either home runs or doubles, while he also leads all active players with 1,932 RBIs.\n\nWith three more years on his Angels contract, Pujols is not done climbing the list. Here is how the native of the Dominican Republic has put himself in such rarefied air.\n\nPujols has hit 620 homers -- good for 20.7 percent of his hits, the third-highest percentage among players with 3,000 hits. His 625 doubles -- 11th most all time -- account for 20.8 percent of his hits, and that total is among the top five percentages in the 3,000-hit club.\n\nPujols leads all active players with 1,933 RBIs, and his 14 seasons with 100 or more is tied with Alex Rodriguez for the most in history. Among players with 3,000 hits, he has the second-highest RBI/games played ratio since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920, according to the Elias Bureau.\n\nPujols is just the sixth player born outside of the 50 United States to reach the 3,000-hit mark. He is the second Dominican-born player, joining Adrian Beltre, who qualified last season.\n\nPujols had 32 hits off three-time All-Star Roy Oswalt, his most against any pitcher, ahead of Aaron Harang (27) and Ben Sheets (26). Odalis Perez may still be having nightmares involving Pujols, who was 16-for-26 (.615) with six homers against the left-hander.\n\nBut don't think Pujols only piled up numbers against second-tier pitchers -- some of his best numbers have come off of the best pitchers of his generation.\n\nPujols would have reached the plateau sooner if not for the free passes. Pujols has 308 intentional walks, the most of any member of the 3,000 club (the recording of intentional walks began in 1955). For the record -- Barry Bonds, who finished his career 65 hits away from 3,000, had 688 intentional walks.\n\n*All stats through May 2","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T03:33:09.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Espn.com"},"urlToImage":"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0419%2Fr358827_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"YIMjsQvyLzLuilMZGcENtQ==\n"}

An earthquake with a 6.9 magnitude hit early Friday afternoon.","title":"In Hawaii, Kilauea Volcano Erupts, Spewing Lava and Gases Near Homes","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/kilauea-volcano-eruption-hawaii.html","text":"There are approximately 1,500 homes in the area, the spokesman said. The Red Cross reported 66 people in two shelters overnight, he added.\n\n“I never thought I’d ever be faced with this, I’m just shellshocked,” said Carl Yoshimoto, 69. He was sheltering at Pahoa Community Center with his two dogs, Sako and Suki, and his partner since Thursday afternoon. Their house is in Leilani Estates.\n\n“As soon as I heard the order to evacuate, I grabbed important paperwork, medications, my wallet — we were out of the house within a half an hour.”\n\nMaddy Welch, 19, who works at Kalapana Bike rentals and lives in Leilani Estates with her mother, had set up a tent and a space at Pahoa Community Center with her two dogs, a goose and her friend, Taylor. “I woke up around 1:30 in the morning to earthquakes,” she said. “My mom didn’t want to leave. I told her there are two vehicles leaving this driveway — I hope you’ll be in one of them because we can’t come back.”\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” she went on. “I don’t know what’s going on.”\n\nOn Thursday evening lava spilled from the crack in the volcano for about an hour and a half, leaving a large smear in a residential area of bushes and trees. Photos and drone footage showed a line of glowing orange slicing through green yards and white vapor and fumes rising above the trees. Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation that made state funding faster to access, and he called up the National Guard to help emergency workers with evacuation efforts.\n\nKilauea is the youngest of five volcanoes that make up the island of Hawaii, and lies on the island’s south. Dr. Mandeville said the signal that there might be more activity was the little earthquakes, which happen when magma moves against rock, in this case, two miles under the earth’s surface. “That’s where the plumbing system is,” he said.\n\nIt remained to be seen how much damage the structures in the evacuation areas have sustained from the eruptions and the earthquakes.\n\nDan Jacobs, 47, who has spent the last six months building his house in Leilani Estates, was standing behind Pahoa Village Museum, a downtown hangout. “I invested all my money here, and I probably won’t have anything to show for it in about a month’s time,” he said. “You should see the floors I built, they’re so beautiful, it’s about halfway done.”\n\nPast volcanic eruptions, some that occurred decades ago, have caused lasting damage to parts of the region.\n\nAn eruption from the Pu’u ’O’o cone of Kilauea in 1983 has continued to flow, destroying houses in the Royal Gardens subdivision. In 1990 more than 100 homes in the Kalapana community were destroyed by lava flow.\n\nAn eruption from Kilauea in 2014 flowed down the surface of the volcano and burned a house in Pahoa. Now residents worry that more structures could be threatened in the area, which is one of the fastest-growing in the state.\n\n“Living on a volcano, everybody has got pretty thick skin. They know the risk,” said Ryan Finlay, who lives in Pahoa and runs an online trade school. “Lava for the most part has flown to the ocean the last 30 years. Everybody gets in a comfort zone. The last couple weeks, everything changed.”","author":"Meghan Miner Murray, Sabrina Tavernise and Maya Salam","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T02:42:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/world/05hawaii-1/05hawaii-1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"6Oxfdp5hz04mHrNrpE8hTQ==\n"}

He's just 29 years old and willing to work toward a new future.","title":"Why Matt Harvey made the right decision to leave the Mets","url":"https://sports.yahoo.com/matt-harvey-made-right-decision-leave-mets-014241864.html","text":"Matt Harvey has thrown his last pitch for the New York Mets. It resulted in a line-drive single. The Mets chose to designate him for assignment in spite of the progress.\n\nBy Friday, the Mets had made Harvey the offer he could only refuse, not because he shouldn’t be in the minor leagues and wouldn’t benefit from the minor leagues, but because Harvey must have come to understand – just as the Mets had – an eight-year relationship had run its course.\n\nIt wasn’t me, they’d almost certainly agree, it was you. Then it’s time to sort the books, grab the spare linens, pat the dog and go.\n\nHe has so much work ahead. He is not – today – a big-league pitcher, a righteous fall not for the pitcher he was for a very short period, but for the pitcher he was going to be. That everyone said he was going to be. That he believed he would be. He’s 29 years old.\n\nMaybe he is not physically able. Maybe his head and heart are unsettled. When he reaches for 98 and gets 92, well, that’s bound to temper a man’s once infinite ego. When the man in the mirror is not among the game’s elite starting pitchers, or even a starting pitcher, or even a decent pitcher, and that man bears a real resemblance to Matt Harvey, the day gets hazy. All the days do.\n\nEveryone loves the guy with the 2-plus ERA who throws his shoulders back and takes on the world and owns the city nights, who could never ever be convinced he wasn’t the best man on the field. That guy is impenetrable. Never ever comes, though, because it always comes, the 2-plus ERA is 7-plus, and then few can understand why that guy can’t muster the humility required to start back toward what he was. He sure as hell isn’t giving the city nights back. The qualities that made him great, that made him him, that made him the next whatever or whomever, those are what he picks over today.\n\nIt takes time, which is what the Mets were hoping to give him, though perhaps not enough. It might take a fresh start. The Mets were incapable of providing that. They will always be them. He will always be him. They will always have their history together, the good and the bad and the what the heck was that. Their future was going to be short.\n\nHarvey was due to leave at the end of the season anyway. They could spend the next five months pretending he was one of their best five starters, one of their best 12 pitchers. Or the Mets could make the dramatic decision to make themselves and Harvey better by sending him to the minor leagues, and Harvey could make the better decision to call it off, to say good-bye, to go get well somewhere else. To get on with it.\n\n“Matt is an appealing, likeable and vulnerable individual. In spite of the issues, I really like Matt. We’re going to miss him, in many ways,” Sandy Alderson told reporters in New York on Friday, which has it about right.\n\nI know Matt Harvey as well as you can know a person who has zero interest in ever talking to you. And I’m going to choose to believe his refusal to report to the minor leagues was a decision made in a moment of composure, not in a fit of anger or humiliation. Not that it really matters anymore. His choices from here, all of them, will have to be made as an answer to a question: What will make me a better pitcher? What is best for my career? How do I make this right again?\n\nThe answer is not to cry about how he should be treated or how he should be viewed. To rage against a front office and coaching staff that have made their own choices. Soon, he’ll have a new team, a new mound, a new future. A new relationship. A lot of new choices.\n\nThe first one – to leave the Mets behind – was a good start.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n • Report: Trump seeks summit with Colin Kaepernick, Kanye West\n\n • LanceMcCullers easily shut down some internet detectives who thought he was cheating\n\n • Report: Hulk Hogan close to WWE return\n\n • What can the Celtics do?

President Donald Trump is weighing whether to pull the U.S. out of Iran’s nuclear deal, a 2015 agreement that capped over a decade of hostility between Tehran and the West over its atomic program. (Vahid Salemi, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON — It’s not as simple as just saying “we’re out” of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIf President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal on May 12, the rest of the world will be thrust into uncharted territory, forced to navigate a complex web of U.S. sanctions that were lifted under the landmark accord but would ostensibly be put back in place.\n\nWould Trump re-impose sanctions on those who do business with Iran? How quickly? And would Europe follow suit? How would Iran respond? And what happens to Iran’s pre-existing obligations to allow nuclear inspections?\n\n“It’s going to be very complicated,” said Ama Adams, who advises clients on international sanctions compliance at the law firm Ropes \u0026 Gray. “There are lots of opportunities to trip up and make mistakes. It’s going to be a period of a lot of activity and flurry.”\n\nA look at possible scenarios for what stays and goes if Trump exits the accord:\n\nUnder the 2015 deal, the United States issued waivers to longstanding sanctions punishing Iran for its nuclear program. Iran, in turn, restricted its program and allowed more inspections.\n\nTrump has essentially two options for re-imposing sanctions.\n\nOn May 12, he faces a deadline on whether to renew the waivers that eased one basket of sanctions: those on Iran’s central bank, intended to hit Iranian oil exports. Another basket of sanctions waivers are up for renewal on July 11, focusing on more than 400 specific Iranian companies, individuals and business sectors.\n\nOne of Trump’s options, being called “the nuclear option” by some experts, would re-impose all the sanctions at once — even those not scheduled for renewal until July. That would put the U.S. in immediate violation of the deal’s terms, which say sanctions remain lifted as long as Iran is complying with its terms. So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear monitoring agency, has said Iran is complying, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agrees.\n\nA second option: re-imposing only the central bank sanctions. That would start a 180-day clock in which companies or countries would be expected to reduce their purchases of oil from Iran. Those that don’t would ultimately be penalized by Washington.\n\nWhy not restore all the sanctions at once? Proponents of doing it piece by piece say it would give the U.S. more leverage to bring about a “fix” to the deal so that Trump could stay in after all. Trump has long said the deal needed to be strengthened or abandoned, but efforts with European allies to strengthen it haven’t yet succeeded. With sanctions about to kick in again in 180 days, there might be enough pressure on the Iranians, the Europeans and other members of the deal to give in to Trump’s demands, proponents say.\n\nBut supporters of the nuclear deal say that’s not a viable option because the U.S., by starting the 180-day clock, would have already breached the deal. And as soon as Trump announces sanctions will be coming back, companies will immediately start shutting down their business with Iran. That means Iran would suffer from lost business and could decide to walk away from the deal itself.\n\nAdams, the sanctions attorney, said some companies have already started winding down business in anticipation that Trump may re-impose sanctions.\n\nTHE REST OF THE WORLD\n\nWhat would Europe do? Germany, France and the U.K. have suggested they have no intention of leaving the deal, even if the U.S. withdraws. But it might not matter much. The global financial system is so interconnected and so tied to New York that it would be almost impossible for anyone anywhere in the world to continue their business with Iran without risk of violating U.S. sanctions. For example, Europe businesses owned or controlled by American parent companies would breach the sanctions if they didn’t cut off Iran.\n\nIt’s a major dilemma for European businesses, made even more complicated if the European Union decides to invoke a measure put in place in the 1990s to counter the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The EU can use those regulations to prohibit European companies from complying with some U.S. sanctions. That puts businesses in the position of choosing whether to defy the United States or the EU.\n\nIran’s leaders have been coy, although Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told The Associated Press last week Iran would “most likely” abandon the deal if Trump withdraws. Yet the key question is whether Iran would resume nuclear activities, such as enrichment and processing, beyond the limits that were imposed by the deal — and how aggressively.\n\nHow would the world even know? If the deal collapses, Iran would no longer be bound by the rigorous inspections regime by the IAEA that it agreed to in the deal. That regime included the so-called Additional Protocol, which expanded the IAEA’s access to sites in Iran, including giving inspectors insight into all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, access on short notice to all buildings at an acknowledged nuclear site, and the right to obtain samples from military sites.\n\nEven without the nuclear deal, Iran would still be required to allow a more limited regime of inspections required by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed. But it’s unclear how rigorously Iran would comply. After all, alleged cheating and delay tactics by Iran were a major concern prior to the 2015 deal. And Iranian officials haven’t explicitly ruled out the possibility that if Trump blows up the nuclear deal, Iran may also leave the Nonproliferation Treaty.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether Iran, feeling swindled on a deal the U.S. itself brokered, would take other steps to retaliate — such as ballistic missile tests or more support for militant groups abroad.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

John Richardson and a Pentagon statement on a potential Joint NATO command in Norfolk.\n\nFaced with a more active Russian fleet and increasing military competition across the world, the Navy has elected to reestablish U.S. 2nd Fleet to manage assets closer to the homeland, according to a memo announcing the command obtained by USNI News.\n\nThe memo, signed by Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer earlier this week, approved reestablishing the command in Norfolk, Va., based on a recommendation of outgoing U.S. Fleet Forces Command commander Adm. Phil Davidson and endorsed by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson.\n\n“As previously briefed to you by the CNO, the re-establishment of SECOND Fleet was directed to better respond to the changing security environment,” reads the memo.\n\n “Commander, SECOND Fleet will exercise training and operational authorities over assigned ships, aircraft, and landing forces in conducting maritime, joint and combined operations in support of designated Unified and Allied Commanders.”\n\nThe command will stand up July 1 and will have an initial manning of 11 officers and four enlisted personnel. The staff will eventually grow to 85 officers, 164 enlisted and seven civilians.\n\n“Our national defense strategy makes clear that we’re back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex,” Richardson said Friday during the Fleet Forces change of command ceremony in Norfolk.\n\n “That’s why today, we’re standing up 2nd Fleet to address these changes, particularly in the North Atlantic.”\n\nWhile the command now exists on paper, the service still needs to work through specifics such as the rank of the commander and how the command and control relationships will work with the joint combatant commands. In its last iteration, a three-star oversaw 2nd Fleet before the command merged with U.S. Fleet Forces in 2011.\n\nUSNI News understands specifics of the plan will be worked through Fleet Forces and its new commander Adm. Christopher Grady, with details to be finalized this summer.\n\nWhile a change in the command and control relationships for warships throughout the Navy was included in the recommendations in the two Navy reviews conducted after a series of fatal collisions in the Western Pacific, the move to stand the fleet back up is rooted in increasing threats in the Atlantic from Russia, several officials familiar with the decision told USNI News.\n\nBefore the 2014 seizure of Crimea by Russian forces, the role of U.S. warships operating on the American side of the Atlantic was largely in support of humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions (HA/DR) missions and drug interdiction work in U.S. Southern Command’s U.S. 4th Fleet. 2nd Fleet was shuttered alongside U.S. Joint Forces Command in 2011, and just years later the Navy and Congress began a push to reestablish 2nd Fleet as Russia grew more aggressive over, on and under the Atlantic.\n\nIn 2016, now-Naval Forces Europe commander Adm. James Foggo III put the conflict in stark terms when he declared the U.S. and Russia were engaged in the “Fourth Battle of the Atlantic.”\n\n“Russian submarines are prowling the Atlantic, testing our defenses, confronting our command of the seas, and preparing the complex underwater battlespace to give them an edge in any future conflict,” Foggo wrote in U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceedings.\n\n “Not only have Russia’s actions and capabilities increased in alarming and confrontational ways, its national-security policy is aimed at challenging the United States and its NATO allies and partners.”\n\nMoving ahead, it’s unclear what the future will be for U.S. 4th Fleet, the naval arm of Southern Command that was established by the George W. Bush administration in 2008. The role of warships 4th Fleet was largely to play host to Coast Guard law enforcement detachments that had the legal authority to interdict traffickers on the high seas and in countries with law enforcement agreements with the U.S. The role for the Navy was diminished in the last several years, however, as the last of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates retired from service in 2015 and as the Pentagon has oriented its efforts towards high-end warfighting.\n\nBefore the establishment of 4th Fleet, the commander of 2nd Fleet was responsible for the central and South American operations.\n\nIn addition to standing up 2nd Fleet, the Pentagon announced it had offered Norfolk as a potential location for the proposed NATO Joint Force Command for the Atlantic.\n\n“The new JFC-Norfolk will ensure that NATO can successfully conduct operations across the full spectrum of Alliance missions in the trans-Atlantic region in the northern Atlantic,” read the statement.\n\n “The future Atlantic-oriented JFC represents part of the ongoing NATO effort to adapt its command structure to ensure that the Alliance can meet the challenges in today’s security environment. It will strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense posture, and its ability to project stability beyond its borders.”\n\nThe decision for the final location of the command will be made this summer.\n\nThe following is the complete May 4, 2018 statement on the proposed NATO command.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense announced today that it has officially offered to host the proposed NATO Joint Force Command for the Atlantic at its naval facilities in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nThe new JFC-Norfolk will ensure that NATO can successfully conduct operations across the full spectrum of Alliance missions in the trans-Atlantic region in the northern Atlantic.\n\nThe future Atlantic-oriented JFC represents part of the ongoing NATO effort to adapt its command structure to ensure that the Alliance can meet the challenges in today’s security environment. It will strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defense posture, and its ability to project stability beyond its borders.\n\nThe North Atlantic Council is expected to make a final determination on the location of the new JFC this summer.","author":"Sam LaGrone","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T18:03:29.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Usni.org"},"urlToImage":"https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/4311769.jpg","digest":"k0xFsQc9NMvmak/2CF7oQQ==\n"}

He added another hit Friday night to pass Roberto Clemente on the career list.","title":"Pujols joins 3000-hit club, then passes Clemente","url":"http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23408128/albert-pujols-los-angeles-angels-gets-3000th-hit-seattle-mariners","text":"Albert Pujols becomes the 32nd member of the 3,000-hit club and just the fourth to have 600 homers and 3,000 hits. (0:56)\n\nAlbert Pujols was once an obscure 13th-round draft pick out of Maple Woods Community College in Kansas City, Missouri, who almost didn't sign a professional contract. Now he's the 32nd member of the 3,000-hit club and just the fourth player in that group to get there while also slugging 600 home runs.\n\nAfter lining out in his first at-bat and walking in his second plate appearance Friday night at Seattle's Safeco Field, Pujols reached the milestone when he singled on a soft liner to right field with two outs in the fifth inning off Mariners starter Mike Leake.\n\nPujols went on to single in the ninth inning, passing Roberto Clemente for No. 31 on the MLB's career list with his 3,001st hit. He finished 2-for-4 with two RBIs in the Angels' 5-0 win.\n\nPujols joined Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Alex Rodriguez in the 3,000/600 club, further solidifying his reputation as one of the best hitters of all time. He's the fourth player in four seasons to reach 3,000 hits, after Rodriguez in 2015, Ichiro Suzuki in 2016 and Adrian Beltre last season.\n\nPujols and Beltre are the only Dominican-born players to reach the milestone.\n\nPujols' trek to 3,000 hits has slowed in recent seasons, but his first 10 seasons with the Cardinals were one of the greatest decades ever for a batter, as he hit .331 while averaging 41 home runs, 123 RBIs and 190 hits. He won three MVPs and finished second in the voting four other times.\n\nThat path to stardom almost didn't happen, at least not with St. Louis. When the Cardinals drafted the stocky shortstop as the 402nd pick in 1999, they initially offered a signing bonus of $10,000. Pujols declined to sign and played that summer for the Hays Larks of the amateur Jayhawk League. The Cardinals finally relented and signed Pujols for a bonus close to $60,000.\n\nWith his 3,000th hit Friday, Albert Pujols joined an elite club of hitters that includes few sluggers of his caliber. Here's how he got there.\n\nHe needed just one season and 127 games in the minors to reach the majors, breaking camp with the Cardinals in 2001 and starting in left field on Opening Day. He got his first hit that day off Mike Hampton of the Colorado Rockies and recently reminisced about the game with ESPN's Jerry Crasnick.\n\n\"I remember my [second] at-bat. I almost took him deep,\" Pujols said. \"I almost hit a home run. I hit a long fly ball, and they caught it right at the wall. Then I hit a pitch middle-away, and I hit a groundball, and Neifi Perez almost caught it, but it went through.\n\n\"Obviously, it's fun, but I was more worried about trying to stay up in the big leagues. Three days before, they told me I was going to make the ballclub. Then three days later, on Opening Day, I got my first hit.\"\n\nPujols would hit his first home run three games later, off Armando Reynoso of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and he was on his way. He hit .329 in his first season with 37 home runs, winning Rookie of the Year honors and finishing fourth in MVP voting.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Pujols' career is that he has never struck out 100 times in a season. That's not unusual for members of the 3,000-hit club, but he's avoided that while hitting for power and playing in the highest-strikeout era in major league history.\n\n\"Some guys in this era think the strikeout is a little overrated,\" Pujols told ESPN. \"They're like, 'I don't care about it.' I do. It's something in this game I really, really don't like.\"\n\nAfter 11 seasons and two World Series titles with the Cardinals, Pujols signed a 10-year, $240 million free-agent deal with the Angels, a contract that has been met with much criticism as his production has declined. Pujols' average dropped to .299 in his final season with the Cardinals in 2011, but he has hit just .261 with the Angels and has never hit .300.\n\nWith St. Louis, Pujols' lowest slugging percentage was .541 (also in his final season there); he's reached .500 only in his first season with the Angels.\n\nDespite teaming with Mike Trout since 2012, the Angels have made just one playoff appearance since Pujols joined the team. He's played through foot injuries that have affected his performance and he still has four years and $114 million left on his deal, including this season, but the contract is widely viewed as an albatross given his sub-.300 OBPs last season and so far in 2018.\n\nStill, it's been a remarkable career. His 99.4 career WAR leads Beltre among active players, and he could become just the 21st position player to reach 100 WAR (and just the 10th to start his career after World War II).\n\nThat extra $50,000 by the Cardinals was worth the investment.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T05:37:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Espn.com"},"urlToImage":"http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0504%2Fr365945_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"DhgfnhkcNO8bEeSVKoeyJw==\n"}

Asked if he had any final words, he said simply, \"Yeah, I've been drinking caffeine all day.\"\n\nThe warden then left the room. It was 9:42. About a minute later, a tube that administers the killing drugs through a wall appeared to pulse. Shortly thereafter, Butts groaned and said \"It burns, man.\"\n\nThen his feet, in white socks visible under a blanket, briefly twitched. He yawned, then a short time later, opened his mouth again, noiselessly. His chest briefly rose as his back arched. Then he took about nine deep breaths, and after that, he lay still.\n\nButts was convicted along with 41-year-old Marion Wilson Jr. in the March 1996 slaying of Donovan Corey Parks, who gave the men a ride outside a Walmart store in Milledgeville on March 28, 1996. The men then ordered him out of the car and fatally shot him, prosecutors said.\n\nJuries in separate trials found sufficient evidence to sentence both men to death because Parks was killed during the commission of an aggravating felony, armed robbery. Wilson's case is still pending.\n\nButts was put to death after the U.S. Supreme Court, without explanation, denied his final appeal. The state Board of Pardons and Paroles, the only authority in Georgia with the power to commute a death sentence, voted earlier not to spare his life. He was the second Georgia inmate executed this year; Carlton Gary, known as the \"stocking strangler\" for raping and killing three older women, was put to death in March.\n\nButts' attorneys insisted in a clemency application to the parole board that he wasn't the shooter, and didn't expect Parks to be killed.\n\nThey also said he shouldn't be executed because given the nature of the crime, they argued that he likely wouldn't be sentenced to death if he were prosecuted today. They said a death sentence was \"grossly disproportionate,\" and unconstitutional because although he was 18 at the time of the killing, his mental age and maturity lagged behind his actual age, it would be like sentencing a juvenile to death.\n\nHis attorneys also said his trial lawyers failed to thoroughly investigate his case or to present mitigating evidence such as childhood abuse and neglect that could have spared him the death penalty.","author":"AP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T03:30:43.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"urlToImage":"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/04/154a3106-e34f-42ce-b4bd-3c9c5419a692/thumbnail/1200x630/0ec0d93557857325f383a66a86a3e040/butts.jpg","digest":"KkcBYtibWGuZAkpVQDTaGg==\n"}

Nielsen, announced Friday the termination of the program that has protected about 57,000 Hondurans from deportation since 1999.\n\nThat designation, known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, came in response to the deadly Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which killed an estimated 10,000 people in Honduras and launched a regional humanitarian crisis.\n\nTPS was created by Congress 1990 to help people from societies wracked by civil conflict or natural disasters.\n\nIn a DHS statement, Nielsen said that she is delaying the effective date for termination of TPS for Hondurans for 18 months, until January 5, 2020.\n\nThe announcement follows similar decisions by Nielsen to end TPS for almost 200,000 Salvadorans, 50,000 Haitians and 9,000 Nepalis. Smaller numbers of Nicaraguans and Sudanese have also lost TPS under the Trump administration. All of these immigrant groups were given more than a year to leave.\n\nIn light of those announcements, immigration advocates were prepared for Nielsen's decision about Hondurans, which they criticized as politically driven and without regard for the actual dangerous conditions in Honduras.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., or CLINIC, the Central American country is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis with a \"staggering\" homicide rate, lack of safe drinking for hundreds of thousands of people and chronic childhood hunger.\n\n\"The administration has attempted to paint a picture that it has no choice but to terminate TPS,\" said CLINIC executive director Jeanne Atkinson.\n\n\"Its action seems to suggest that all of the past Republican and Democratic administrations that extended TPS for Honduras have not properly applied the law. To the contrary, it is the Trump administration's action that disregards the law and the intent of Congress in creating TPS in the first place to safeguard human lives,\" said Atkinson.\n\nBut supporters of the Trump administration praised the announcement.\n\n\"The hurricane that justified it in the first place was two decades ago,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates immigration limits. \"At some point, temporary needs to mean temporary.\"\n\nHowever, Krikorian said, he would have preferred that the Trump administration gave Hondurans only six months to arrange to leave and not eighteen months.\n\n\"It [TPS] has to stop somewhere and somebody is going to be inconvenienced by this,\" he added.\n\nBut Miami business owner Orlando Lopez calls the decision a \"disaster\" for him and his family. He's 55, has a small trucking company with ten employees and he supports his family back in Honduras.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Lopez said Americans don't understand how difficult life is in Honduras.\n\n\"I'm afraid to return. It's a matter of life or death, \" said Lopez.\n\n\"Here, I have a business. I pay taxes. I have a clean record. I will have to leave it in God's hands,\" he added.\n\nThe government of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that the decision to end TPS was a sovereign issue for Washington, adding that \"we deeply lament it.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, an ex-Honduran ambassador to the U.S. and former Central Bank president Hugo Noe said the decision will create uncertainty for many families and he predicted that most Hondurans who were covered by TPS will choose to remain in the U.S. illegally rather than return home.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T02:21:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Npr.org"},"urlToImage":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/04/ap_18125078764288_wide-fc0ff5bcc8ce10fdc83d79de9d80a7a8a71ac2c3.jpg?s=1400","digest":"kdPrveADO9rcMtksL68miw==\n"}

It knocked out power to some residents who were already dealing with mandatory evacuation orders, molten rock and high levels of sulfur dioxide in the air.\n\nThe situation wasn't getting any better, Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno told reporters Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Activity continues. It doesn't look like it is slowing down,\" he said.\n\nMagno said five volcanic vents have opened and indicated that at least one home and another structure were destroyed by lava.\n\nIt is highly unusual to see the vents so far from Kilauea volcano, he said.\n\nHundreds of people have evacuated from Leilani Estates, a community of about 1,700 people, and Lanipuna Gardens. Harry Kim, mayor of Hawaii County, said the government will support residents, including those who want to go back to their homes to pick up some belongings.\n\n\"We have to work with them as to how we are going to minimize (the inconveniences) as best as possible,\" he said. The mayor said people who want to check on their homes would be allowed into the neighborhoods.\n\n'We had to evacuate,' resident says\n\nStephen Clapper said there was no choice.\n\nClapper became one of hundreds of residents to flee the threats from the volcanic eruption. He said he told his mom on Friday morning to pack a bag, just in case.\n\nBut with lava setting trees ablaze and threatening homes, and with gas coming out of cracks in the ground, Clapper went back to the house, got his mother and the dogs, swept up some of his clothes in one arm, and took off for a shelter.\n\nUS Geological Survey seismologist Jana Pursley said there have been 119 earthquakes on the Big Island since Thursday afternoon. The USGS said Friday's 6.9 quake was the most powerful on the island since 1975.\n\nAbout 14,000 customers of Hawaii Electric Light lost power immediately after the earthquake.\n\n\"We've had some unofficial reports there (is) some damage to some buildings,\" spokeswoman Rhea Lee-Moku said.\n\nLee-Moku said power has been restored to about half of the customers who were without, but sulfur gas levels in some areas are beyond what Hawaii Electric Light deems safe so they cannot work in those places.\n\n\"When you are exposed to that level of SO2 in the Leilani Estates area you need more protection than we have available to us,\" she said.\n\nKHON reported that some viewers on the island of Oahu, about 200 miles away, felt the shaking.\n\nVideo posted on social media showed lava spewing several feet into the air from a new crack in a Leilani Estates street. Aerial videos showed lava searing a long orange and smoky line through a wooded area.\n\nJeremiah Osuna, who used a drone to record one of the videos Thursday, said the area \"sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could,\" according to KHON.\n\n\"You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff,\" Osuna said, according to the TV station. \"I couldn't believe it. I was kind of shaken a little bit and realizing how real everything is, and how dangerous living on the East Rift can be.\"\n\n\"We knew it was coming, and even now it's ... really surreal at this point,\" Stenback told KITV.\n\nA thick plume of smoke and ash also rose Thursday from the Puu Oo volcanic vent, roughly halfway between Kilauea's caldera and Leilani Estates.\n\nDestructive molten flows weren't the only concern. Volcanic eruptions can release potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide -- and fire department personnel have detected high levels of the gas in the evacuation area, the civil defense agency said.\n\nBreathing large amounts of sulfur dioxide could result in burning of the nose and throat and breathing difficulties, the agency says.\n\nGov. David Ige said he's activated the Hawaii National Guard to help with evacuations and security.\n\n\"I urge residents in Leilani Estates and the surrounding areas to follow instructions. ... Please be alert and prepare now to keep your family safe,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe Guard will do security patrols and help evacuate residents, Hawaii Adjutant General Arthur \"Joe\" Logan said.\n\nSince Monday, several hundred earthquakes -- most of them around magnitude 2.0 -- have been recorded in the area. The series of quakes came after a collapse of a crater floor of Puu Oo.\n\nThe tremors have jarred residents, who've been reporting nearly constant ground vibrations. They have also reported cracks in roads.\n\nShe said the flurry of earthquakes seemed to happen every minute.\n\n\"It'd be like the house would shake. It'd be like somebody that weighs 300 pounds came in my living room, and jumped up and down,\" she said.","author":"Jason Hanna, Madison Park, Joe Sutton and Steve Almasy, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T02:08:15.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180504140830-03-hawaii-kilauea-volcano-0504-super-tease.jpg","digest":"UfFD4BsN9m1EIvbF2kgd9Q==\n"}

The first outbreak was short-lived, lasting only a few hours and causing no known structure damage.\n\nBut by Friday afternoon there were at least six active fissures in the community, destroying a home and two other buildings, sending dangerous gas into the air, and forcing the evacuation of the entire subdivision.\n\nFurther, the ground shook steadily throughout the last two days, with hundreds of tremors of magnitude 2.5 or higher, with the strongest quake measuring magnitude 6.9 at 12:32 p.m. and centered in Leilani Estates, followed by countless aftershocks. The largest quake knocked out power to thousands, caused slight sea-level fluctuations and scared residents throughout the islands. It did not generate a tsunami.\n\n“Things started shaking side to side. That was huge, the longest I ever felt,” said Hilo resident Bobbie Stivers-Apiki.\n\nHilo Hawaiian Hotel bellman Alan Shinkai said he was in the elevator during the quake. “I wanted to reach the ground as fast as possible,” he said.\n\nThe seismic and volcanic hyperactivity led to numerous closures and disruptions across the Big Island.\n\n\u003e\u003e All residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens Subdivisions are required to evacuate.\n\n\u003e\u003e The American Red Cross opened two shelters at the Pahoa and Keaau community centers. The Pahoa center had 200 residents by this afternoon while the Keaau center had 2 residents.\n\n\u003e\u003e The Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was closed in the afternoon “for the safety of our visitors and employees” after the violent shaking from the 12:32 p.m. quake. Park officials evacuated 2,600 visitors, relocated guests at Volcano House hotel and Kilauea Military Camp, and sent home all non-emergency park employees. “Safety is our main priority at Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, and it is currently not safe to be here,” said Park Superintendent Cindy Orlando. “We will monitor the situation closely, and reopen when it is safe to do so.”\n\nPark officials said the quake triggered rock slides on trails, crater walls, and along Chain of Craters Road, while an earlier magnitude-5.4 quake caused a coastal cliff to collapse into the ocean near the Holei Sea Arch. The quake also caused narrow fissures in the ground at an overlook near Jaggar Museum, and rock falls into the lava lake within Halemaumau Crater, sending up dark clouds of ash.\n\n\u003e\u003eThe largest quake cut power to 14,400 Hawaii Electric Light Co. customers. By 2:25 p.m., service had been restored to all customers, the company reported.\n\n\u003e\u003e Kua O Ka La Charter School, Hawaii Academy of Arts and Science, Keonepoko Elementary and Pahoa High, Intermediate, and Elementary were closed today.\n\n\u003e\u003e About 70 members of the Hawaii National Guard were deployed to the island to help with evacuation and other efforts. Those citizen-soldiers include six from the Guard’s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team who will help the county with air quality tests. Hawaii National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Charles Anthony said the team will bring equipment to help detect sulfur dioxide in Puna and provide air samples to the county.\n\nHawaii Fire Department reports extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas detected in the evacuation area. Elderly, young, and people with respiratory issues need to comply with the mandatory evacuation order and leave the area.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions for the area above lower Puna until 11:59 p.m. Monday, due to the volcanic activity. The restrictions cover a five-nautical-miles radius of Pahoa, from the surface up to 3,000 feet above sea level. No pilots may operate an aircraft — including drones — in the area. Relief aircraft operations under the direction of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency are authorized in the airspace.\n\n\u003e\u003e The county Department of Water Supply issued an emergency water restriction for Leilani Estates, Nanawale Estates, Kapoho and Lanipuna Gardens, telling all water customers to immediately restrict water use to health and safety needs only.\n\n\u003e\u003e On Thursday, Puna Geothermal Venture operations have shut down indefinitely until further notice. County officials said the facility is secure.\n\nAll the volcanic activity in Puna — and its dramatic images — have grabbed the attention of national and international media, prompting the Hawaii Tourism Authority to remind the traveling public that most of the action is in a remote, sparsely populated area, and that most of the state is unaffected by earthquakes and molten lava.\n\nGeorge D. Szigeti, HTA’s president and chief executive, reassured travelers that flights haven’t been affected by the Kilauea volcano and the “area where lava is coming to the surface is very far from resort areas throughout the Hawaiian Islands where visitor accommodations are located.”\n\nGov. David Ige said in a statement, “We have heard from people around the world concerned about Hawaii’s welfare and want to reassure everyone that this is limited to a remote region on the slopes of Kilauea volcano. Everywhere else in the Hawaiian islands is not affected.”\n\nStill, the quakes and flowing lava has unnerved many on the Big Isle.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman, of Keaau, said items were falling off the shelf while he was at Island Naturals, his Hilo natural food store, when the magnitude-6.9 quake struck.\n\n“This last one was scary,” he said, adding that he lived in San Francisco for 10 years and experienced some there. “It starts rocking and keeps on going. It’s very frightening. We’re rattled.”\n\nEvacuated Puna residents Henry and Stella Caleo, 64, said they don’t know if their home would still be standing.\n\n“We don’t know anything,” Stella Caleo said. “We don’t know if we’re going to lose our house. We know nothing.”\n\nThe uncertainty extends to what Kilauea volcano will do next.\n\nLate this afternoon, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials said that active volcanic vents continue on Makamae, Kaupili and Mohala streets, and near the intersection of Leilani Avenue and Kahukai Road.\n\nThey warn of “extremely dangerous conditions” due to sulfur dioxide in the evacuation area. “The high levels detected are an immediate threat to life for all who become exposed. First responders may not be able to come to the aid of residents who refuse to evacuate,” they said.\n\nThey also caution that more lava vents and more powerful earthquakes are possible in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nHonolulu Star-Advertiser reporters Dan Nakaso, Tim Hurley, Rosemarie Bernardo, William Cole, Nina Wu, and Allison Schaefers contributed to this report.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T05:12:27.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Staradvertiser.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/web1_lava-video-screenshot.jpg","digest":"JwR7X8Ts5Uoccl9eUF/qJw==\n"}

After running over the Warriors in a 119-100 Game 3 victory, that confidence will only grow stronger. Anthony Davis had a monster night going off for 33 points and 18 rebounds while Rajon Rondo came through with 21 assists and 10 rebounds of his own, one fewer assist than the entire Warriors team combined. The Pelicans controlled the tempo throughout the night, never allowing the Warriors' vaunted offense to develop any rhythm.\n\nRajon Rondo is back on point with Pelicans 'I've been counted out my whole life, since the day I was drafted'\n\nPelicans coach Alvin Gentry continued to fuel his team with belief throughout the past few days, reiterating before Friday's contest that the Pelicans knew they could beat the Warriors at their own game -- running and gunning up the floor against stars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. The key for Gentry in Game 3 was that his team played with a defensive ferocity that set the tone throughout the night.\n\nThe Warriors weren't getting a lot of clean looks and weren't able to push the tempo like they usually do. Warriors swingman Klay Thompson bounced back after a 4-for-20 performance in Game 2 with 26 points in Game 3, but Curry was held to 19 points, going just 6-for-19 from the field. Golden State could never find the answers it needed against a hungry New Orleans group that came ready to play. Once Davis got rolling, nothing could stop him.\n\n\"I don't remember exactly when it was but that was the message,\" Davis said. \"We can't lose this game. It's always tough to come back from 0-3, but our mindset is to go out there and play. Do what we're supposed to do, follow the game plan and whatever results happen, happen.

Pelicans guard Ian Clark led the way for New Orleans, lighting up Golden State for 18 points in 21 minutes. Rondo and Draymond Green continued their series-long exchange of trash talk, but it was Rondo who earned the last laugh in Game 3 -- as a raucous sellout crowd in Smoothie King Center gave the Pelicans several standing ovations throughout the night.\n\n\"We understand that we won one game and Game 4 will be the toughest game that we've ever had,\" Gentry said. \"And we understand that about them. But I don't think our confidence has wavered, and it shouldn't, because we think that we're a good basketball team and we think when we play to the level that we're capable of playing that we do have an opportunity to play and win the game against anyone.

Moon held his own summit with Kim on April 27, at the heavily militarized border between the two Koreas. That session was considered among the last steps before Trump could schedule a face-to-face meeting with Kim.\n\nAnother step may be the release of three Americans held in North Korea, which would be a significant show of goodwill from Kim.

She said they'd saved their own money to make the trip.\"This was their dream school and I wanted to give them that opportunity,\" said the mother Lorraine Gray.By the time they showed up, the tour had already begun.\"A parent participating in the tour called campus police because she was nervous about the presence of two young men who joined the tour while it was in progress,\" the school said. \"When the police confirmed the brothers were part of the tour, they let them rejoin the group. But by that time, the tour had moved on.\"\"It breaks my heart, because they didn't do anything to warrant that,\" Gray told reporters. \"They're walking on their own ancestors' land, so it breaks my heart.\"Colorado State officials said they are working to ensure there's not a repeat of such an incident. They are inviting the two teenagers back to the school, saying it will pick up the tab for them to travel back there for a VIP tour with their family.The school also said Friday it would refund the money the brothers spent to travel to the school for Monday's tour.\"As a university community, we deeply regret the experience of these students while they were guests on our campus,\" they said. \"The fact that these two students felt unwelcome on our campus while here as visitors runs counter to our principles of community.\"Colorado's Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne said her office was concerned as well. Lynne also serves as the chair of Colorado's Commission on Indian Affairs.\"We want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring our public universities are open and welcoming to all students and hope that the young men will not be deterred in their pursuit of attending college in Colorado, a traditional homeland to many tribal nations,\" Lynne said.","author":"melanie lawson, eyewitness news, anchor, live at five","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T22:14:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Abc13.com"},"urlToImage":"http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/ktrk/images/cms/automation/vod/3429826_1280x720.jpg","digest":"qZ7/6M21GUNymnaBv5ntQA==\n"}

A number of decisions, like who would command Second Fleet and what assets it would include, have not yet been made.\n\nIn 2011, the fleet was disbanded for cost-saving and organizational structure reasons.\n\nSince then, however, Russia has become more assertive, flexing its military muscles in conflicts like those in Ukraine and Syria, and tensions between Moscow and Washington have increased.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. military said in a new national defense strategy that countering Russia, along with China, would be a priority, the latest sign of shifting priorities after more than a decade and a half of focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.\n\nIn presenting the new strategy, which will set priorities for the Pentagon for years to come, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called China and Russia “revisionist powers” that “seek to create a world consistent with their authoritarian models.”\n\nRussia has increased its naval patrols in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic and the Arctic, NATO officials say, although the size of its navy is smaller now than during the Cold War era.\n\nSince taking office last year, President Donald Trump has tried to build stronger ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut relations have instead soured over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russia’s alleged poisoning of a former double agent in Britain and Putin’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon also announced on Friday that it was offering to host a proposed NATO Joint Force Command at its naval facilities in Norfolk.\n\nIt was one of two proposed new NATO commands aimed at deterring Russia that the United States and Germany had offered to host.","author":"Idrees Ali","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T18:52:56.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png","digest":"NkOcaTIMYr6o19Eh3XahTA==\n"}

And he was trying to block out the memory of the Pelicans’ last home game against these Warriors in the playoffs.\n\nHe had the perfect seat then, next to Warriors coach Steve Kerr, his top assistant and offensive coordinator, the man in charge of engineering an epic comeback from a 20-point deficit that would lead to a Game 3 win in that first-round series and an eventual sweep of the Pelicans that helped propel the Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green-led Warriors to the NBA title in 2015.\n\nSo yeah, it was on his mind, even if everyone else in the building tried to say it wasn’t, that it was ancient history and that it had no impact on this current Pelicans team.\n\nGentry knew better than that and confessed as much as his team drew blood in this series with an emphatic 119-100 Game 3 win this time around.\n\n“Obviously, it’s going to stick with you,” Gentry said of that pivotal 2015 game that ultimately led to the Pelicans hiring him away from the Warriors. “I was on the Warrior bench then and I thought [the Pelicans] played great game. And because I was on the Warrior bench it made it so scary tonight … I was there when Steph started making threes and then Klay started making threes and before you know it a 20-point lead was nine points and then seven points, and then all of a sudden Steph made a shot out of the corner, which by the way I have a picture of that on my phone that I’ve kept all of these years and now I can eras it off.\n\n“But there just a scary team, you never feel comfortable. Even when he [Kerr] took his guys out, I was like ‘let’s play two more minutes before we take [our] guys out. Because you are just never comfortable with that team.”\n\nGentry helped chase the ghost of that 2015 game away for the a franchise, a city and especially his stars on Friday night.\n\nBoth Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday were on that team that collapsed three years ago. They needed this win more than they realized, more than they cared to acknowledge late Friday night after the building had cleared out and everyone had a chance to process what had just transpired.\n\nThe Pelicans beat the Warriors at their own game, employing the “appropriate fear” Gentry joked about with the media afterwards.\n\nIt was all there, starting with relentless defense and sweet shooting; 14-for-31 from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nIt continued with the sudden bursts of energy from all directions; Solomon Hill knocking down three deep 3-pointers early and reserve guard Ian Clark, crushing his former team for 18 points, including daggers down the stretch.\n\nIt was punctuated by Davis and Holiday grinding away like the guys who fueled the Pelicans’ first-round sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers, and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo breathing as much verbal fire as Green, while also driving the Pelicans with 21 assists, the first player with at least 20 in a playoff game since he did it in himself in 2011 when he was with the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Warriors simply couldn’t keep up. And Curry didn’t the have the same touch or adrenaline he had in his playoff debut in Game 2, when he torched the Pelicans for 28 points in 27 minutes off the bench during his first action after missing nearly six weeks with a knee injury.\n\n“Most of it is attributed to the Pelicans,” Kerr said. “Their defense was great. They were the aggressors. I thought they brought the force, the necessary force to the game on their home floor, and these are the ebbs and flows of a playoff series, especially when you get past the first round. Everybody is really good and that’s a team that just swept Portland in the first round and on their home floor down 2-0, this is kind of what you expect.”\n\nGentry has unleashed all that.\n\nWhen the Pelicans lost All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending Achilles injury in late January, the framework for this team had to be altered completely.\n\nThe Pelicans had to lean on Davis to dominate the way he did Friday night (33 points on 15-for-27 shooting, 18 rebounds, four steals and three assists). Holiday (21 points, seven rebounds, five assists) had to be set free to resume the All-Star ways he showed earlier in his career.\n\nAnd Rondo needed the keys to the car and the freedom to guide the Pelicans’ young stars to the edge the way he has throughout this postseason, complete with at least two more face-to-face skirmishes with Green Friday night.\n\n“That’s the way he plays, he talks a lot of …” Rondo said after being informed that Green suggested he was trying to bait him into a confrontation.","author":"NBA.com","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T05:17:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Nba.com"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/styles/landscape_1045w/s3/2018-05/daivs-postgame-celebrate.jpg?itok=9QEm9Mla","digest":"eyx/JwsHsKQbeAOJo251aw==\n"}

Meanwhile the level of the lava lake inside the volcano was continuing to drop.\n\nTwo homes had been destroyed in the latest activity, ABC quoted Hawaii island Mayor Harry Kim as saying.\n\nResidents described fleeing their homes on Thursday evening.\n\n\"My family is safe, the rest of the stuff can be replaced. When I bought here 14 years [ago], I knew that this day would eventually come. But the reality is sinking in now,\" one resident told Hawaii News Now.\n\nA spokesperson for the county of Hawaii's Mayor, Janet Snyder, said \"elevated levels\" of sulphur dioxide were stopping people returning to evacuated areas.\n\n\"It is quite toxic and in fact, even our first responders find it too hazardous at this time to go back into the sub-divisions without heavy, protective equipment,\" she said.\n\nThursday's eruption prompted a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents.\n\nCommunity centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees.\n\nKilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes.\n\nOfficials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning.\n\nA volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas.\n\nHawaii's Governor, David Ige, said he had activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people.\n\nWe live in Leilani Estates, about six blocks away from the eruption.\n\nWe were evacuated a couple of hours ago and we are now with friends.\n\nWithin about half an hour of the eruption, it was on social media, so me and my daughter went down to look at it. You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it.\n\nIt was like when someone plays the bass really heavy, and you can feel the bass - you could really feel the power and the lava - the colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable.\n\nIt sounds very explosive... It's spitting out as hard as it can. It's not so much what you hear, it's what you feel.\n\nOne resident says: I'm not leaving\n\nEarlier this year, a false alert warning of an incoming ballistic missile caused panic, leading the US state to reassess its alert system.\n\nAre you in the area?

Cher and Bono were married from 1964 to 1975.\n\nKardashian West’s trip to Las Vegas comes as her rapper husband is under fire for previous comments he made about slavery being “a choice” during a live TMZ interview earlier this week.\n\nThe couple escaped to Jackson Hole so West could put the finishing touches on his album, due May 25, PEOPLE confirmed.\n\nA Keeping Up with the Kardashians source told PEOPLE Kardashian West “happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole.”\n\n“She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album,” the source said. “The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.”\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kanye West Has Had ‘Explosive’ Fights With Kris Jenner \u0026 Kim Kardashian Can’t ‘Control’ Him: Sources\n\n“Kim is absolutely concerned about Kanye,” the insider continued. “She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn’t want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.”\n\nThe two welcomed their third child together, daughter Chicago, on Jan. 15. The mogul has been busy balancing her businesses and being a mom to three young kids — and it’s been an adjustment for her husband.\n\nOn Friday, a different source close to the Kardashian family told PEOPLE the trip is giving the couple quality time.\n\n“She had been spending a lot of time focusing on work and career and being a mom,” the insider said. “He missed her. He wanted to spend more time with her, and she was just focused on juggling it all.”\n\nAs previously reported by PEOPLE, the reality star is also continuing to stand by her man despite the public backlash. “Him acting like this sort of comes with the territory,” says the source. “She knows it comes and goes, and I think she realized this time she needs to spend a little more time with him, hence being with him in Wyoming.”\n\n“She truly does believe he’s such a genius and an artist and inspiring and loves him so much,” adds the source. “It’s more that she’s disappointed people don’t get to see him the way she knows him and hates that everyone is fixated on him this way.

It was awesome.”\n\nA crowd of 21,536 at Estadio de Beisbol Monterrey saw Buehler stay steady despite early rain. In just his third start in the majors, he went six innings before Tony Cingrani , Yimi Garcia and Adam Liberatore closed it out.\n\nBuehler, a 23-year-old taken in the first round of the 2015 amateur draft, struck out eight and walked three. After 93 pitches, the highly touted right-hander was pulled. Cingrani walked two in the seventh, but the lefty kept the bid intact.\n\n”It*s probably one of the toughest conversations I ever had, I wanted to keep going,” Buehler said. ”But they made the choice and the guys finished out and it was cool.”\n\nBuehler overcame wet conditions – the hardest rain fell in the second inning.\n\n”I threw one in high school, but I gave up two runs in the first inning, so that one doesn’t really count,” Buehler said.\n\nGarcia struck out two in a perfect eighth and Liberatore threw a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out Franchy Cordero to end it with the Dodgers’ 146th pitch.\n\nThat ended a festive night that began with a ceremonial first pitch thrown by Dodgers great Fernando Valenzuela , who became a star in the U.S. and Mexico and set off ”Fernandomania” when he became a fan favorite in the 1980s.\n\nValenzuela pitched a no-hitter against St. Louis at Dodger Stadium on June 29, 1990, the same night Oakland’s Dave Stewart pitched a no-hitter at Toronto – one of five in Canada, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nThe Dodgers threw this no-hitter on the same night Albert Pujols of the Los Angeles Angels got his 3,000th hit in a game at Seattle. When Pujols hit his 600th home run at home against Minnesota last June 3, Miami’s Edinson Volquez pitched a no-hitter at home against Arizona.\n\nThese dual accomplishments evoked memories of the day in 1985, too, when Rod Carew got his 3,000th hit and Tom Seaver won his 300th game.\n\nAnd the team with the most no-hitters in major league history – Boston is second with 18 – accomplished the feat against the only franchise that hasn’t pitched any.\n\nThis series was part of Major League Baseball’s push to internationalize the sport. No doubt, souvenirs from this game will wind up in the Hall of Fame\n\nBuehler’s highest pitch count in the majors is 94 pitches, reached in his previous outing against San Francisco.\n\n”It’s one of those where you’re pretty angry to come out, but the bullpen, the guys that we have, I trust it in their hands, too,” he said. ”And it worked out.”\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts isn’t afraid to pull a young pitcher during a no-hitter. He removed then-rookie Ross Stripling from a bid against San Francisco with one out in the eighth inning in 2016. Reliever Chris Hatcher allowed a home run to the next batter.\n\nThis one worked out better for Roberts, giving baseball its second no-hitter of the season. Oakland left-hander Sean Manaea threw the first against Boston on April 21.\n\nJoey Lucchesi (3-2) allowed three runs and five hits as the last-place Padres dropped to 11-22.\n\nMatt Kemp had an RBI single on a popup that fell between shortstop Freddy Galvis and right fielder Matt Szczur in short right field in the first inning, and Chris Taylor and Enrique Hernandez hit consecutive homers in the second. Alex Verdugo singled in a run in the sixth against Adam Cimber.\n\n”This is the fourth time that I get to see a no-hitter, but the first one that I’m on the good end of it,” Hernandez said. ”Walker was electric and the relievers did a great job. It*s not an easy feat. It*s a night that no one is going to forget.”\n\nDodgers: RHP Julio Urias made the trip to his native Mexico. The 21-year-old had surgery last June to repair the left anterior capsule in his pitching shoulder, and his return was projected at 12-to-14 months. Roberts said Urias’ return will not be until the second half of the season.\n\nThe Monterrey series continues with Dodgers RHP Kenta Maeda (2-2, 3.76 ERA) opposing RHP Bryan Mitchell (0-3, 6.07) on Saturday.","author":"AP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:42:36.000Z"},"source":{"id":"fox-sports","name":"Fox Sports"},"urlToImage":"https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2018/05/201805042229809729858-p2-1.vresize.1200.630.high.10.jpeg","digest":"I4Uue6YDlLuOHT44udiU9w==\n"}

I’ve made that very clear.’ Photo: Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa—Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the strictest abortion ban in the nation into law on Friday, setting Iowa up for a lengthy court challenge.\n\nThe law bans most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe Iowa affiliates of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union have warned they would sue the Republican governor if she signed the bill, which the GOP-controlled Legislature approved earlier in the week.\n\n“We will challenge this law with absolutely everything we have on behalf of our patients because Iowa will not go back,” said Suzanna de Baca, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, in a statement.\n\nGov. Reynolds said before the bill was sent to her desk: “I’m pro-life. I’m proud to be pro-life. I’ve made that very clear.”\n\nThe legislation has propelled Iowa to the front of a push among conservative statehouses jockeying to enact the nation’s most restrictive regulations on the procedure.\n\nIn March, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed a law that banned abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, except in the case of medical emergencies or severe fetal abnormalities. That law and similar legislation in other states are on hold while they are being challenged in court.\n\nCritics say the so-called heartbeat bill would ban abortions before some women even know they are pregnant. That likely sets the state up for a legal challenge over its constitutionality, including from the same federal appeals court that three years ago struck down similar legislation approved in Arkansas and North Dakota.\n\nBackers of the legislation, which failed to get a single Democratic vote in either Iowa chamber, expressed hope it could challenge Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a fetus is viable. Conservatives say an influx of right-leaning judicial appointments under President Donald Trump could make it a possibility.","author":"Wall Street Journal","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:33:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-wall-street-journal","name":"The Wall Street Journal"},"urlToImage":"https://images.wsj.net/im-9453/social","digest":"Lccme254g7DhPCdxuP98/g==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aed72670a500bdef4333d41"},"description":"With unemployment below 4 percent for the first time since 2000, the recovery’s duration is remarkable, but lagging pay remains a riddle.","title":"Jobless Rate Looks Like Old Times, but the Economy Doesn't","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/business/economy/unemployment-jobs.html","text":"President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, “4% is Broken!”\n\nThe steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride — or, as it was branded, “irrational exuberance” — went before a fall.\n\nBut the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.\n\nThe most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven’t been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.\n\nFriday’s report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.\n\n“A 3.9 percent rate today doesn’t suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s,” said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley’s chief United States economist.\n\nA lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it’s easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.\n\nIn fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.\n\nThe population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.\n\nIn 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nFifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it’s not even one in 10.\n\nThe tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s — a feat not repeated since.\n\n“No one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore,” said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.\n\nMr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers’ complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Trump’s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.\n\nEconomists say it is too soon to tell how employers may change their hiring or expansion plans in response to the tariffs on Chinese goods, or to Beijing’s retaliation. But there are signs that companies that buy metals are feeling the effects already. The Institute for Supply Management said this week that manufacturing activity grew in April at its slowest pace since July.\n\nUncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\n\n“A faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers,” Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.\n\nHowever mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. “We are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don’t know exactly when it is going to happen,” she said.\n\nA wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy’s roofing company in Clive, Iowa.\n\nThree years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour. No longer. In March, the latest month measured at the state level, the jobless rate in Iowa was 2.8 percent, one of the nation’s lowest. Mr. Steffy now pays roofers $25 an hour, including benefits.\n\nHis rate for subcontractors has been spiking. It went up 7 percent in March, and will rise another 7 percent in May. There will be bumps in June and August, too. It’s all Mr. Steffy can do to keep himself in the game.\n\n“There’s a price war going on for labor,” he said. He has had crews leave job sites before finishing a roof because they got a better offer from another contractor. “The next 18 months are going to be crazy,” he said.","author":"Natalie Kitroeff","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T23:14:02.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/business/05JOBLESS/05JOBLESS-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"1Ll2jvvabHq8KkfdDB+THQ==\n"}

Misleading statements about the domestic abuse scandal that felled staff secretary Rob Porter had dragged the administration into a maelstrom of chaos and contradictory public statements.\n\nExasperated, Sanders told McGahn she would not continue to speak for the administration unless she was provided more information about Porter’s situation.\n\nThe dispute, which erupted in a hallway outside Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin’s office, was resolved after Sanders received the clarity she sought, the people familiar with the argument said. Hours later, Sanders returned to her lectern to field queries from a skeptical press corps, though her answers left reporters with more questions.\n\nThe moment illustrates the precarious role Sanders has chosen to fill as the public face of the Trump administration — and the doubts about her credibility in representing a president who traffics in mistruths and obfuscations.\n\nSanders was thrust into an especially harsh limelight over the past week. She was the subject of an acerbic broadside about her “bunch of lies” by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. Then she was forced to explain the inconsistent accounts from her, President Trump and his new personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, about the hush money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. The week was punctuated by an onslaught of commentary about Sanders’s character.\n\nBy virtue of her position, Sanders is inextricably bound in the mistruths of the Trump administration. She is a willing warrior for Trump, and her critics say she should be held accountable for his utterances — from the untruthful to the racist to the sexist. Since taking office, Trump has made more than 3,000 false or misleading claims, according to an analysis by The Washington Post’s Fact Checker.\n\n[Trump and his attorney didn’t tell the truth, if Giuliani is right. Will that change anything?]\n\n“When the president blithely admits to lying, it makes all those who are paid to repeat and defend his stories liars, as well,” said David Axelrod, who was a senior White House adviser under President Barack Obama. “Their credibility is tied to his. It’s a high price to pay for a job, even in the White House.”\n\nSanders, 35, is no political ingenue. She was raised in the wild-and-woolly politics of Arkansas, the only daughter of former governor Mike Huckabee, and grew up to work on his two unsuccessful presidential campaigns.\n\nBy the time she took over as White House press secretary from Sean Spicer in July, the administration’s penchant for misleading the public at the president’s direction was well established. At his first press briefing, Spicer vigorously misrepresented the size of Trump’s inaugural crowds, soaring to national fame for the wrong reasons.\n\nThose in Trump’s orbit argue that the attacks on Sanders have been more sustained and personally vicious than those faced by press secretaries in previous administrations. They argue that in a hyper-polarized nation — and amid the frenzied environment nurtured by a president who is at war with what he calls the “Fake News” media — Sanders has become an unwitting Rorschach test for Trump’s critics.\n\nAllies of Sanders say that she often pushes back on Trump, who wants her to attack the media even harder and more frequently, and that other administrations have also faced credibility problems, such as the mistruths on the Monica Lewinsky affair under President Bill Clinton and the false information on weapons of mass destruction under President George W. Bush.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who holds this job for President Trump, they’re going to be unfairly attacked and ridiculed,” said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser. “Since Sarah Huckabee Sanders works for President Trump, it seems to be open season on her professionally and personally.”\n\nSanders declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nFresh trouble for Sanders arose Wednesday night, when Giuliani, in a freewheeling interview with Sean Hannity, told the friendly Fox News host that Trump had reimbursed his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 in hush money he paid to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. The payment helped secure her silence shortly before the 2016 election about an alleged sexual affair with Trump a decade earlier, which the president has denied.\n\nGiuliani’s disclosure appeared to be at odds with Sanders’s repeated insistence that Trump was not aware of Cohen’s payment to Daniels. The interview, which Sanders did not coordinate, left her in an untenable position, she told colleagues.\n\nSo did Giuliani’s proclamation that three American prisoners soon would be released from North Korea, a development the White House had not confirmed.\n\nReporters pressed Sanders on Thursday: Was she a liar or simply in the dark? And why was the president’s personal attorney authorized to announce news about sensitive hostage negotiations?\n\n“I’ve given the best information I had at the time,” Sanders said, a line she repeated in general six times. “Some information I am aware of, and some I’m not.”\n\n[The Fix: Sarah Huckabee Sanders basically just blamed Trump for misleading her]\n\nSanders said she first learned that Trump had reimbursed Cohen by watching Giuliani’s interview with Hannity. At another point in her briefing, she repeated her assertion that she does not intentionally mislead the public, but acknowledged that she is not always provided the most accurate or complete information about her boss.\n\nSanders also offered a general criticism of peddling untruths — or, as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway once memorably dubbed them, “alternative facts.”\n\n“I would always advise against giving false information,” Sanders said. “As a person of human decency, I do my best to give the right information.”\n\nSanders’s defenders say she spends considerable time crafting talking points that convey the president’s wishes but also are technically truthful. If she is guilty of anything, they say, it is providing incomplete information.\n\nIn the Daniels episode, for instance, Sanders has largely cited the president’s own statements and referred questions to his outside attorneys.\n\nBefore most briefings, she meets with Trump in the Oval Office to discuss how he would like her to answer news-of-the-day questions, White House officials said. The president sometimes dictates lines for her to read or orders her to use precise words on particularly sensitive matters.\n\nSanders routinely dodges questions on hot topics by telling reporters she has not asked the president about it — a deliberate strategy to avoid having to wade into delicate issues, according to a Sanders confidant.\n\nShe deflects nearly every question about the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the election unless she has a prepared statement from the president to read — a protective move against creating legal exposure for herself with extemporaneous answers.\n\n“Sarah has done a fantastic job of keeping in line with understanding how to effectively communicate what the president’s thoughts are at any given time, recognizing that it is a very dynamic and fluid situation in many cases,” Spicer said. “What she has done is, she has realized, you can’t get in trouble for what you don’t say.”\n\nBehind the scenes, Sanders has joked with colleagues that she has no idea whom the president will fire, what he will tweet or when he might change his mind. Unlike the more pugilistic Spicer, Sanders has privately displayed a gallows humor.\n\nSanders sometimes finds herself out of the loop and is not the ubiquitous presence that former communications director Hope Hicks was in the president’s daily life.\n\nWhen Trump offered John Bolton the job as national security adviser, the president had already begun configuring his own press strategy before Sanders was alerted, according to White House officials, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. Sanders was soon hustled into the Oval Office shortly before Trump tweeted about the hiring.\n\nAfter Trump revealed that he was urging states to send troops to the U.S.-Mexican border, Sanders scurried to figure out why he had said that and how it would work, only to learn he had been briefed on a proposal the week before, officials said.\n\nIn a West Wing riven by infighting and a revolving door, Sanders is one of the only senior officials who does not generally draw arrows. She has lasted longer than some of her colleagues expected.\n\nDuring the Porter saga, colleagues say, they frequently saw Sanders upset as she managed the fallout. She helped craft a statement that defended Porter and that later became an embarrassment to the administration. But, officials said, she was careful not to betray the administration’s missteps publicly, as her deputy Raj Shah had when he said that “we all could have done better” — which attracted criticism from the president.\n\nAlthough combative with reporters on camera, Sanders is largely regarded as more pleasant and helpful behind the scenes. She works to provide reporters answers to their questions, including hunting down colleagues for help.\n\nSanders often mentions her three small children during her briefings, reminding the millions of viewers tuning in on television that she is a mother. She sometimes makes hokey jokes to leaven the mood in the briefing room and is known to wish some reporters a happy birthday from the lectern.\n\n“Sarah has always been coolheaded and professional and always gives our arguments for greater transparency and openness a respectful hearing,” said Olivier Knox, the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, who will assume the presidency of the White House Correspondents’ Association this summer.\n\nLast Saturday night, Sanders sat next to Knox at the head table for the correspondents’ dinner. She did not stand up to congratulate the journalists who were presented awards — including a team from CNN, which Trump has assailed as “fake.” And as Wolf mocked her, joking that she “burns facts and then uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,” Sanders sat stoically.\n\nLater that evening, Sanders and her husband, Bryan, were spotted at the invite-only MSNBC after-party, greeting friends and reporters well after midnight.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T22:52:12.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oV8ouq918gtKnT8yMaqXmX8sf9c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JDXA44CP5AI6RBFAIWFBVKNMBI.jpg","digest":"ALKRtFTZd7qPn8iBoNAjEQ==\n"}

It’s more of a 365-day holiday. Or it should be, because whether you hail from the Bay Area or Southern California, chances are good that you revel in margaritas and tacos all year round.\n\n“Yes, we do!” says chef Deborah Schneider, from San Diego’s SOL Cocina. “It’s so funny. It’s really an American holiday with a go-for-broke party, a time to be silly and enjoy.”\n\nCinco de Mayo is the anniversary of an 1862 battle between the Mexican and French armies in Puebla — but the big celebrations are held north of the border. Go figure. We suppose it’s fallout from the Saint Paddy effect, which turns everyone wildly, greenly Irish in mid-March, or the Hans phenomenon that renders them boisterously Bavarian during Oktoberfest. Or — even likelier — it’s the tasty food. Our passion for tacos, salsa and glorious guacamole makes a Cinco de Mayo party a must.\n\nOf course, for chefs like Schneider and Joanne Weir, co-owner of Sausalito’s Copita, that party runs all year round. So who better to offer advice on throwing the ultimate taco party?\n\n“I always lead with margaritas. Shots are a bad idea!” Schneider says. “My other essentials are stick-on mustaches, which double as Frida Kahlo eyebrows for the ladies. We play Mexican pop music and serve fish tacos, carne asada, guacamole, salsas and other good things.”\n\nTequila and fresh lime are a near-unbeatable cocktail combination, but margaritas have additional benefits for party hosts, who can dilute the cocktails as the night progresses, Schneider says, or serve them sans alcohol for designated drivers. And they’re an easy cocktail to serve. Weir makes both her signature Copita Margarita and her serrano-spiked Hot Lips version in batches and serves them in pitchers or poured into individual glasses or — even better — in canning jars stashed on ice.\n\n“Fill a big galvanized metal tub with ice and canning jars, so people can just pick them up,” the James Beard award-winning cookbook author and culinary instructor says.\n\nDrop an oversized ice cube into the jar or glass and you can control the serving size and melt rate better. Besides, she says, giant ice cubes look great.\n\nChips, guacamole and salsas are musts for any Mexican-themed party, and even the most classic fare can be customized any which way. Start with Schneider’s pico de gallo, featured in her new cookbook, “Salsas and Moles” (Ten Speed Press, $16.99, 152 pages). The salsa — the name refers to a rooster’s beak — includes chopped fresh Roma tomatoes, a little white or red onion, minced jalapeño, fresh cilantro and enough fresh lime juice to make it zippy — 1 tablespoon of lime juice to 3 tomatoes.\n\nBut the Yucatán version is xni-pec, she says by phone from San Diego: “It means ‘dog nose’ in Mayan. They put habanero in to make your nose run. Or add mango, pineapple or even cucumber. I love cucumber in pico de gallo. It makes it crunchy, almost like a salad. Maybe add a little shrimp, too.”\n\nMultiple salsas are always good thing, Schneider says, and her restaurant’s most popular table salsa is the Black Bean Salsa Borracho: “We use it as a dip. It’s really good — and it doesn’t drip.”\n\nWeir’s favorite is a vibrantly hued salsa verde, made with tomatillos, lime juice, garlic, chiles, cilantro and a last-minute flourish of fresh mint. “It is so fabulous,” she says. “You throw everything in the blender, except the mint. Add chunks of avocado — or save the avocado for guacamole. Everyone loves guacamole. I think you have to make it.”\n\nA ceviche with fresh scallops or aguachiles with shrimp makes an easy, refreshing dish. And, of course, you have to do tacos.\n\n“Tacos are everyone’s favorite,” Weir says. “People just love that with carne asada, fried oysters or chicken tinga.”\n\nHer chicken tinga starts with a slow simmer of tomatoes, onions and enough garlic to banish any Cinco de Mayo-loving vampires, then amps up the flavor with chipotle chiles, adobo sauce and brown sugar. Shredded, roasted — or rotisseried — chicken is added for the final simmer, then tucked into warm corn tortillas and embellished with salsa verde and a squeeze of lime.\n\n“This is how I would entertain on Cinco de Mayo,” Weir says. “I don’t want people to spend hours and hours.” So rather than lavishing hours on time-intensive desserts to round out the menu, Weir whips up Oaxacan Chocolate Milkshakes. She blends rich dark chocolate ice cream with a couple of ice cubes, a dash of minced chipotle en adobo, ground chile guajillo and ground cinnamon — “plus a good splash of anejo tequila.”\n\nThis post was originally published in April 2015.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:46:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Mercurynews.com"},"urlToImage":null,"digest":"33DvFJ+0n//Wfe+9sJdiDA==\n"}

He's been out of prison since 2013, when the courts first ordered a new trial.\n\nThe court ruled Friday that Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, \"rendered ineffective assistance\" by failing to identify an alibi witness for his client, and that as a result, Skakel was deprived of a fair trial.\n\nProsecutors can choose to retry Skakel, according to the decision, but the defense would now have the benefit of that alibi testimony. The prosecutor's office was not immediately available for comment.\n\n\"We've been fighting for this for a long time,\" Skakel's current attorney, Hugh Santos, said. \"We're happy that the habeas court was vindicated and Michael is similarly elated.\"\n\nSkakel's first cousin, Robert Kennedy, Jr. -- who wrote a book insisting Skakel was innocent -- told CNN he was skeptical the case would be retried because of a new witness. \"It would be pretty hard to pass the threshold of reasonable doubt,\" Kennedy said. Prosecutors said Skakel was 15 when he killed his neighbor Martha Moxley, also 15. Her body was found in October 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death; a broken golf club was found near her body. Skadel has always said he was innocent. Though Skakel had been a suspect for years, he did not go to trial until 2002, when he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. One of Skakel's three previous appeals went to the US Supreme Court but in 2006 the justices declined to hear that petition. In October 2012 he was denied parole, but a year later a state appellate judge determined that the case presented by his defense attorney Sherman was \"constitutionally deficient\" and ordered a new trial. Skakel was released from prison on bond in November 2013. In December 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court reinstated the 2002 murder conviction, but Skakel's lawyers appealed. On Friday, the state Supreme Court reversed its own decision. Mark Dupuis, communications and legislative specialist at Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice, told CNN: \"We are reviewing the court's opinions and have no comment at this time.\" Moxley's mother, Dorthy, told CNN on Friday that she didn't expect the decision. \"It is what it is and we just have to go from here,\" she said. \"I'm willing to do whatever the state of Connecticut wants me to do.\" \"I was 43 when she was murdered and I'll be 86 next month,\" she said. \"This has been going on for half my life.\" Robert Kennedy, Jr. said he talked to Skakel earlier Friday. \"We were expecting the decision today,\" Kennedy said. \"He was optimistic.\" Kennedy wrote a 2016 book titled, \"Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit.\" When asked if he thinks this is finally over for his cousin, Kennedy responded, \"The prosecution now has the option of re-trying Michael. But they are sitting on an hour-long confession from Tony Bryant that's come to light.\" He was referring to a statement by Gitano \"Tony\" Bryant , a cousin of former Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, in which he implicates two friends in Moxley's murder. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled the name of Martha Moxley's mother.","author":"Ralph Ellis and Jean Casarez, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T21:12:11.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180504164817-michael-skakel-2016-super-tease.jpg","digest":"hd6xOQ8IQtWLFcKx5H90vA==\n"}

So, May 5.\n\nWe've been through this already.\n\nThere was no Cinco de Mayo war.\n\nThe holiday celebrates Mexico's victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. It was a relatively minor battle -- the French reclaimed Puebla a year later -- but a symbolic one because a small Mexican army defeated a larger occupying force. By 1867, Mexican troops had driven France from the country.\n\nMany Americans assume Cinco de Mayo is Mexico's Independence Day. It's not. That holiday falls on September 16 and commemorates the Grito de Dolores, a priest's ringing of a church bell in the town of Dolores in 1810 that triggered Mexico's War of Independence from Spain.\n\nNo. Día de Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a three-day holiday in which families across Mexico gather to remember deceased friends and family members. It's usually held from October 31 to November 2.\n\nWherever you want it to be.

(1:10)\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- Draymond Green wants the truth to be told.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors' All-Star power forward said he's not the one in this Western Conference semifinal series initiating the multiple encounters he's had with New Orleans Pelicans guard with Rajon Rondo.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans believed they could beat the Golden State Warriors at their own game -- and proved it.\n\n\"I haven't been getting into it with Rondo,\" Green said adamantly after the Warriors' 119-100 loss in Game 3 on Friday. \"You've seen me get into it with people before. When have I gotten in into Rondo this series? Maybe once. I wouldn't even say getting into it, though.\"\n\nThe question then was reworded as \"face-to-face\" encounters.\n\n\"That's basketball,\" he snapped back. \"You're going to be face-to-face with somebody. That's how you guard.\"\n\n• Forecast: New predictions for each series\n\n • Why can't AD get the respect he deserves?\n\n • LeBron puts on clinic, Cavs school Raptors\n\n • Celtics show resilience in Game 2 win\n\n • Smart puts his unique stamp on playoffs\n\n • Adams: Is 'Playoff Rondo' a real thing?\n\n • NBA playoff MVPs: Ranking the top 10\n\n • Injuries that are impacting the playoffs\n\n • NBA offseason guides for eliminated teams\n\n • Tickets on Vivid Seats\n\nMost of their confrontations have occurred during stoppage of play.\n\n\"Oh, OK. How many times have I walked up to him?\" Green asked. \"I haven't got into it yet with him, period.\"\n\nRondo claims Green is indeed the instigator.\n\n\"Nah, that's his game,\" the point guard said. \"I don't try to bait him at anything. He talks a lot of s--- and that's part of it. We're competing. I don't think it's nothing more than us battling on the court. He's a great a competitor and I love competing against him. I'm just trying to match his intensity.\"\n\n\"He's as hard-headed as they are,\" said Pelicans' coach Alvin Gentry about Rondo. \"I don't think you're ever going to see him back down from anyone. He's an unbelievable competitor, he's a great team guy, he's going to stick up for his teammates. He's just one of those guys -- he's not going to back down from anyone. I understand that, I just tell him he's got to know when to let it go, though, because obviously it would be a huge loss if we would lose him in a situation like that.\"\n\nGreen does have an argument. In their first encounter, it was Rondo who walked near the Warriors' bench at the onset of halftime. They bumped chests and began jawing back and forth before players and coaches pulled them apart. And then late in Game 3, it appeared as if Rondo tried to trip Green from behind as the forward was walking toward his bench during a timeout.\n\n\"It's kind of just how I am,\" Rondo said about his competitive nature. \"I don't know if that's really trying to set an example. It's just guys talking trash on the other team -- it's kind of just natural for me to respond. Not in a crazy way or anything, just let them know we're not a pushover. We're here to fight, and with my guys on the court, I'm going to fight as hard I can for these guys -- whatever it takes.\"\n\nHowever, Green isn't completely in the clear. In the middle of the first quarter on Friday, the Pelicans called a timeout and Rondo tried to attempt a 3-pointer, a routine most players partake in to get in a shooting rhythm without it counting as an official field goal attempt. It also has become routine for opposing players to attempt at denying the free shot. Green guarded Rondo while both teams walked to their respective benches and the two eventually began lightly shoving each other. Two officials quickly intervened and separated them.\n\nThe reigning Defensive Player of the Year is adamant that he's not the one baiting.\n\n\"Nah, I don't have to try to bait Rondo,\" Green said. \"I get nothing out of trying to bait Rondo at anything. That does nothing for me. So, once again, when have I went up to him and tried to bait him? Y'all hate the storyline of somebody trying to bait me. I actually got to be involved. Like, 'Draymond's doing this.' At some point, somebody got to tell the truth. It ain't Draymond this time. I've baited a lot of guys. I've tried to bait a lot of guys, succeeded quite a bit. Sometimes failed. I ain't trying to bait nobody.\"\n\nGentry said Green is playing by the book.\n\n\"I don't think anything he does crosses the line because -- he's the perfect guy because if he's on your team you love him, and if he's not on your team you despise him,\" said Gentry. \"To me, those are the kind of players that I'd like to have on the team. All he does is win. Wherever he's been, he's won. And so what I think you have to do, you have to play well enough to win the game, then that right there does all the talking. But he's going to talk and I appreciate it. I saw him today -- we spent 20 minutes together. And I appreciate who he is and how he plays and what he's all about because he's all about winning. And if you're verbally weak, then he's going to take advantage of you. I think our guys understand that at this point in the game.\"\n\nGreen and Rondo both dismissed their brush-ups as frivolous, but Green was serious in reiterating that he wants accuracy from the media in telling how these incidents have come to be. \"At some point, somebody has to tell the truth and I know that's' not quite the DNA these days of people telling the truth,\" Green said. \"But at some point y'all got to tell the truth. Draymond ain't trying to bait nobody. I'm chilling. Playing basketball. I look forward to y'all telling the truth one day. Maybe it won't happen. I ain't expecting it, but I do look forward to it.\"","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T05:10:31.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Espn.com"},"urlToImage":"http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0504%2Fr365966_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg","digest":"UqvcUPn9fkZWXEvKQdi4tQ==\n"}

Clapper went back to the house, got his mother and the dogs, swept up some of his clothes in one arm, and took off for a shelter.\n\nAbout 14,000 customers of Hawaii Electric Light lost power immediately after the earthquake. Spokeswoman Rhea Lee-Moku said power has been restored to about half of the customers, but sulfur gas levels in some areas are too high for employees to work.\n\n\"When you are exposed to that level of SO2 in the Leilani Estates area, you need more protection than we have available to us,\" she said.\n\nDestructive molten flows weren't the only concern. Volcanic eruptions can release potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide. Fire department personnel have detected high levels of the gas in the evacuation area, the civil defense agency said.\n\nBreathing large amounts of sulfur dioxide can result in burning of the nose and throat, and breathing difficulties.\n\nGov. David Ige said he's activated the Hawaii National Guard to help with evacuations and security.","author":"Susannah Cullinane and Steve Almasy, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T09:42:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180504140830-03-hawaii-kilauea-volcano-0504-super-tease.jpg","digest":"aMmqMBwQdBpr5gk8ByPmrg==\n"}

Cinco de Mayo (May 5) commemorates the Mexican army's unlikely victory over the French forces of Napoleon III on May 5, 1862, at the Battle of Puebla. It’s not considered a Mexican federal holiday. For Americans, it’s a time to enjoy Mexican food and a few margaritas. This year, ​​​​​​​restaurants nationwide are offering deals, including $1 tacos and drinks. Dollarita, anyone?

Residents there were ordered to flee amid threats of fires and “extremely high levels of dangerous” sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nAfter the eruption, the island shook at regular intervals, but especially so around midday Friday: A 5.6 magnitude quake hit south of the volcano around 11:30 a.m. local time, followed about an hour later by a 6.9-magnitude temblor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe latter was felt as far away as Oahu and struck in nearly the exact same place as a deadly 7.4-magnitude earthquake had in 1975, according to the USGS.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed homes visibly shaking, items clattering to the floor at supermarkets and waves forming in swimming pools as the 6.9 magnitude quake rattled the Big Island Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low following the earthquakes, though officials warned that residents were not in the clear yet.\n\n“Everything is still elevated,” agency administrator Talmadge Magno said, according to Hawaii News Now. “It kind of gets you nervous.”\n\nKilauea’s eruption Thursday had sent white, billowing clouds of steam and volcanic ash into the sky and prompted emergency officials to order mandatory evacuations.\n\nAuthorities warned residents to stay out of the area Friday as molten rock shot high into the air from cracks in the ground in Leilani Estates, a subdivision in the island’s eastern Puna district that is filled with wooden homes tucked away on lush, tropical plant-filled lots. About 1,700 people live in Leilani Estates.\n\nThe civil defense agency said there was “active volcanic fountaining” in the neighborhood, meaning the lava was springing up from ground fractures; reports indicated it was shooting 80 to 100 feet into the sky. At least six fissure vents have opened in the subdivision so far — and more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone, the Geological Survey said.\n\nDrone footage showed lava oozing forth along the fissures that had formed, inching toward homes in Leilani Estates and leaving lines of smoldering trees in their wake. At least two homes in the subdivision caught fire, Hawaii News Now reported.\n\nThursday’s eruption prompted the County of Hawaii’s acting mayor, Wil Okabe, to issue a state of emergency. Gov. David Ige (D) also issued an emergency proclamation and activated Hawaii’s National Guard to help with evacuations.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, at least a few hundred people had evacuated their homes in Leilani Estates and nearby Lanipuna Gardens, taking refuge at local churches, Red Cross shelters and with family and friends in other parts of Hawaii, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nGabbard warned that, in some ways, the threat from the sulfur dioxide gas could be more dangerous than the lava flows, which had stopped in places after the eruption. If conditions worsened, even first responders would not be able to go into the affected neighborhoods to help trapped residents, she added.\n\n“Sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal, especially to those who have respiratory illnesses,” Gabbard said. “The wind can push [the gas] in different directions, so that’s a very serious concern given the high levels and, you know, people don’t necessarily have the kinds of protective gas masks that they would need if they were right in the thick of this gas.”\n\nKilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on Hawaii Island, according to USGS. The eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island Thursday morning.\n\nGeologists said the current seismic activities around Puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption, according to Hawaii News Now. That eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava, the news site reported.\n\nMore recently in 2014, lava again threatened the Puna district, specifically the town of Pahoa and its surrounding area, The Post reported. During that event, lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour, and up to 60 structures were at risk.\n\nHawaii might be about to ban your favorite sunscreen to protect its coral reefs\n\nHawaii missile alert: How one employee ‘pushed the wrong button’ and caused a wave of panic","author":"https://www.facebook.com/lindseybever","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T15:50:35.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y4okUDwK_wipgPZyDwu4B4FEHY4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OIXEBVSYAY3XNNOSPXYJEG7UA4.jpg","digest":"fAotSEYqOluo0hkSw+sW+A==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aedee280a500bdef433521e"},"description":"Tens of thousands of investors have descended on Omaha Saturday for the annual meeting of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. DealBook will be here providing analysis","title":"Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting 2018: Trade 'Is a Win-Win Situation'","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/dealbook/berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-stock.html","text":"But just how Berkshire’s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.\n\nMr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort a are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire “within a couple of months,” he added.\n\n“Whether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,” he mused “We’ll see if that will happen.”\n\nBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\n\n“We are attacking an industry moat,” Mr. Buffett said. “That’s a huge moat. We’ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.”\n\nCharles Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman, weighed in: “I suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won’t be very friendly to the existing” pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers’ identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.\n\nThe Federal Reserve earlier this year restricted its growth until it demonstrates it is complying with bank regulations.\n\nBerkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank’s biggest holder with a nealry 10 percent stake.\n\nIn response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo’s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\n\n“All the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,” he said.\n\nHe specifically praised the bank’s chief executive, Tim Sloan, a longtime Wells Fargo executive who took over when his predecessor John Stumpf resigned at the height of the fake account scandal. Criticism from Mr. Buffett could have increased pressure on Mr. Sloan. But the 87-year-old praised him.\n\n“I like Tim Sloan as a manager,” Mr. Buffett said. “He is correcting mistakes made by other people.”\n\nMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could’ve happened anywhere, he said.\n\n“We know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can’t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.” On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: “Wells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it’s just that they had the wrong incentives.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.\n\nSo it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here’s Mr. Buffett’s response:\n\nWarren Buffett warned in his annual letter that a new accounting rule would “severely distort Berkshire’s net income figures and very often mislead commentators and investors.”\n\nSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.\n\nIn the first quarter, Berkshire’s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.\n\nGiven the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire’s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire’s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company’s performance.\n\nBerkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\n\nThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\n\n• What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? — Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\n\n• What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway’s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this? —Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n• What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? — Jason Lu, Shanghai\n\n• Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? — Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\n\n• He’s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? — Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n• How long he plans on doing this. —Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\n\nShareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods — many created specifically for the event — from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.\n\nWhat was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.\n\nInvestors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag “Warren and Charlie” rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth). There were Justin cowboy boots embroidered with the words “Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Shareholders Meeting” and guests had the option to “Put yourself in Warren Buffett’s boots,” as the marketing materials suggest, and purchase a style that had been owned by the man himself.\n\nJim Van Fossen, a retired financial planner, bought matching Berkshire Hathaway boxers for himself and his son, Conner Van Fossen. In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders’ meeting.\n\nOf course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses. See’s Candies displayed Scotch Kiss confections “made by Warren,” and one staff member’s uniform bore Mr. Buffett’s autograph.\n\nThe most photographed autograph was at the Benjamin Moore paint booth, where Mr. Buffett had signed his name in permanent marker next to a wall-size mural of his face. All day long, revelers followed suit, decorating the wall with their own signatures in dry-erase ink, and snapping selfies to preserve the memory.\n\nBy some measures, Berkshire had a quiet year. The company failed to announce any major acquisitions since Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger took the stage a year ago.\n\nStill, in January, Berkshire did team up with Amazon and JPMorgan to form an independent health care company, and two longtime executives were promoted, positioning them as possible successors.\n\nAlso, shares of Berkshire surpassed $300,000 in December for the first time. To put that in perspective, Mr. Buffett paid $7.50 a share for his initial stake.\n\nSuccession: Mr. Buffett has faced persistent questions over the years about who will succeed him as chief executive of Berkshire. Mr. Buffett has largely sidestepped the questions. This year, though, the issue should draw greater attention. In January, Mr. Buffett named the longtime Berkshire executives Gregory E. Abel and Ajit Jain, as vice chairmen. “It’s part of a movement toward succession over time,” Mr. Buffett said in an interview on CNBC at the time.\n\nApple: Mr. Buffett famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn’t understand them. There now seems to be one exception to that rule. Berkshire continues to snap up shares of Apple. Since Berkshire first took a stake in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the investment has grown into Berkshire’s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple’s shares.\n\nDeal making: Mr. Buffett admits that Berkshire is in the midst of a deal-making dry spell. The company made no big acquisitions in 2017, and that streak has continued into this year. In his annual letter, Mr. Buffett said acquisitions have gotten too pricey. That “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers,” Mr. Buffett wrote. The problem is Berkshire has become so big that spending on large acquisitions has become key to its growth. Some investors in Berkshire may become impatient with the lack of acquisitions, especially as the company’s cash pile had increased to $116 billion by year end.\n\nOmaha, Neb., is not typically the center of the financial world. But once a year, that is what it becomes, attracting hedge-fund managers, business executives and mom-and-pop investors to the annual meeting of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOver the past five decades, the meeting has transformed from a small gathering of shareholders in the cafeteria of National Indemnity into “Woodstock for Capitalists.”\n\nTens of thousands of shareholders fill the CenturyLink Center in Omaha each year to ask Mr. Buffett and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman, questions about the conglomerate, investing, the economy and politics. And between bites of See’s toffees and sips of Cherry Coke, the pair dole out their brand of folksy wisdom and corny jokes.\n\nDealBook will be here through it all providing analysis.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T15:25:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/business/dealbook/06db-briefing-buffett2/06db-briefing-buffett2-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"zdCUe/U5ELwo2eq0YboDzg==\n"}

Kim Reynolds signed one of the country's most restrictive abortion bills into law on Friday.\n\nThe so-called \"heartbeat\" legislation bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat has been detected, at about six weeks of pregnancy. Exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers worked late into the night this week to push the measure forward. During Tuesday's debate in the Statehouse, Rep. Sandy Salmon said, \"A baby has become something we can throw away. This bill says it's time to change the way we think about unborn life.\"\n\nThe bill passed the state House on Tuesday and the state Senate early Wednesday. Then it landed on Reynolds' desk.\n\n\"I understand that not everyone will agree with this decision,\" Reynolds said in a written statement. \"But if death is determined when a heart stops beating, then doesn't a beating heart indicate life? For me, it is immoral to stop an innocent beating heart.\"\n\nThe legislation drew firm Republican support. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst tweeted, \"Glad to see Iowa leading the way and standing up for the most vulnerable in our society, the unborn. Thank you @IAGovernor for taking this important step forward in protecting life.\"\n\nNo Democrats voted for the bill. \"This unconstitutional bill is nothing but a thinly veiled attack on Iowa women's most basic rights and freedoms — every woman deserves the fundamental right to make decisions about her own body with her doctor,\" Democratic National Committee women's media director Elizabeth Renda said in a written statement.\n\nIowa has permitted most abortions up to 20 weeks. Critics of the new law say the six-week deadline will prohibit abortions before women may even realize they are pregnant.\n\n\"The likelihood that an individual can miss her period, get a pregnancy test, then make an appointment to see an abortion provider, take time off of work if she's working, find child care for her other children, get in to get her abortion and have all of that done prior to a six-week time period is absolutely unrealistic and unreasonable,\" said Dr. Jamila Perritt, a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, which advocates for contraception and abortion rights.\n\nPerritt said the law is simply designed to limit access to abortion. \"The reality is that it's justice by geography. Abortion is legal in this country.\"\n\nAt a rally on Friday at the Iowa State Capitol, Suzanna de Baca, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, said the organization would file a lawsuit against the governor if she signed the bill. The organization tweeted, \"We will fight like hell with everything we have.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union also announced plans to sue with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\nReynolds knew that her signature would be incendiary. \"I understand and anticipate that this will likely be challenged in court and that courts may even put a hold on the law until it reaches the Supreme Court,\" she said in the statement. \"However, this is bigger than just a law. This is about life.

Lieberman, not Sarah Palin, as his running mate in 2008.","title":"At His Ranch, John McCain Shares Memories and Regrets With Friends","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/politics/john-mccain-arizona.html","text":"And some of his associates, though not his family, have started to quietly put out word that they want a “McCain person” eventually appointed to fill his Senate seat, a roster that includes his wife, Cindy.\n\nMr. McCain, 81, is still in the fight, struggling with the grim diagnosis he received last summer: He has been leading conference calls with his staff in a strained voice, grinding out three-hour physical therapy sessions and rewarding himself most days with a tall glass of Absolut Elyx on ice.\n\nBut his health has become a matter of immediate political interest. Mr. McCain’s future may determine whether Republicans retain their single-seat Senate majority: Should the senator die or resign before the end of May, there will most likely be a special election for the seat this fall. But under Arizona law, if he remains in office into June, there will probably not be an election for the seat until 2020, which Republicans would prefer given Democratic enthusiasm this year.\n\nThe matter of succession for the McCain seat — a topic of such intense discussion that Republicans officials here joke that Washington lawyers know Arizona election law better than any attorney in the state — is officially verboten among party officials and the senator’s friends. They are determined to reward him with the same good ending that his friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy enjoyed before he succumbed to brain cancer in 2009.\n\nMr. McCain, who is not doing interviews, delights in sitting out on his deck where he once handled slabs of ribs on the grill, friends say. He and his wife listen to the hummingbirds and the burbling stream that runs through their 15-acre ranch, enjoy the verdant scenery in an otherwise arid region and divide their loyalties when the hawks start pestering Peanut, their Chihuahua mix. (Mrs. McCain sides with their dog, Mr. McCain the hawks.)\n\nA bout of diverticulitis temporarily landed him back in Phoenix’s Mayo Clinic last month. It caused him to miss seeing more than a hundred of his friends and colleagues, including the new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who came to Arizona to attend the annual meeting of his foreign policy think tank, the McCain Institute.\n\nMr. Lieberman filled in for Mr. McCain at the forum and visited the senator afterward at the hospital, mixing talk of North Korea and Iran with well-worn jokes, like the one about the difference between a lawyer and a catfish. (One is a bottom-feeding scum-sucker; the other is a fish.)\n\n“He was O.K., but he wanted to get out of the hospital,” recalled Mr. Lieberman, one of Mr. McCain’s closest friends. “Look, this is a man whose whole life has been active.”\n\nHaving spent over two years in solitary confinement while he was imprisoned in Vietnam, Mr. McCain has no use for being alone, whether it is in the intensive care unit or at his ranch. And his deck is where he receives a constant flow of friends — with visits that often end with Mr. McCain saying, “I love you” — and takes calls on the iPhone he just swapped for his tattered flip phone. (Mr. McCain finally made the switch to download the Major League Baseball app to better follow his Arizona Diamondbacks.)\n\nMr. Biden and his wife, Jill, were there last weekend; Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican, and his wife, Cheryl, visited Friday; other colleagues are set to come this week and his seven children are there as often as they can. The phone calls have been even more frequent: former President George W. Bush checked in last week, telling Mr. McCain the country is missing him.\n\nIn a visit on the deck earlier this year, Mr. Flake said he and Mr. McCain recalled how in the 1980s the legendary former Arizona congressman Morris Udall, a Democrat, had taken the newly elected Mr. McCain under his wing despite their differences in party.\n\n“It was the two of us lamenting the loss of the politics of the past,” Mr. Flake said.\n\nIt was also at his Hidden Valley Ranch where the senator participated in a nearly two-hour HBO documentary and co-wrote what he acknowledges will be his last book, “The Restless Wave,” both of which are set to be released this month.\n\nThe film and the book, a copy of which The New York Times obtained independently of Mr. McCain, amount to the senator’s final say on his career and a concluding argument for a brand of pro-free trade and pro-immigration Republicanism that, along with his calls for preserving the American-led international order, have grown out of fashion under President Trump.\n\nIn the book, Mr. McCain scorns Mr. Trump’s seeming admiration for autocrats and disdain for refugees.\n\n“He seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes,” he writes of the president. “The appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.”\n\nYet many in Mr. McCain’s own party believe that, by selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, he bears at least a small measure of blame for unleashing the forces of grievance politics and nativism within the G.O.P.\n\nWhile he continues to defend Ms. Palin’s performance, Mr. McCain uses the documentary and the book to unburden himself about not selecting Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent, as his running mate.\n\nHe recalls that his advisers warned him that picking a vice-presidential candidate who caucused with Democrats and supported abortion rights would divide Republicans and doom his chances.\n\n“It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,” he writes. “But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.”\n\nEven more striking is how Mr. McCain expresses his sorrow in the documentary. He calls the decision not to pick Mr. Lieberman “another mistake that I made” in his political career, a self-indictment that includes his involvement in the Keating Five savings and loan scandal and his reluctance to speak out during his 2000 presidential bid about the Confederate battle flag flying above the South Carolina Capitol.\n\nMr. Lieberman said he didn’t know Mr. McCain felt that regret until he watched the film. “It touched me greatly,” he said.\n\nHere in his adopted state, he has been immortalized as an icon. “John McCain is a giant in Arizona,” said Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, expressing sentiments that were echoed by the teachers protesting at the state Capitol last week.\n\nErik Gillman, a math instructor, said Mr. McCain had become the new Barry Goldwater, a figure as inextricably identified with the desert as cactus.\n\n“It’s what people think about when they think about the state: the Grand Canyon and John McCain,” Mr. Gillman said.\n\nBut Mr. McCain’s conservative detractors have not forgiven his maverick tendencies simply because he is ill.\n\nWhen Mr. Pence addressed a hard-right audience gathered in Tempe last week to promote the administration’s tax cuts, he said that “people all across America are praying for Senator John McCain” — and one woman yelled out, “to retire.”\n\nMr. McCain has long been both a flawed politician and a larger figure of history, by virtue of his refusal to be released early from Vietnamese captivity. Former Senator Robert J. Dole, for example, wore Mr. McCain’s P.O.W. bracelet while his future colleague was in the Hanoi Hilton prison camp.\n\nMr. Dole, now 94, said he planned to tell Mr. McCain in a coming phone call, “You’re a tough guy and you can overcome this.”\n\nIn Washington, Mr. McCain’s admirers believe the Senate and the G.O.P. lack a needed counterbalance to Mr. Trump and worry that his absence only presages a larger decline in the country’s politics. With Mr. Kennedy gone and Mr. McCain ailing, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights legend, is one of the few figures left in Washington who evoke a bigness at a moment in history that can seem all too small.\n\n“The Senate is changing just like the country is changing,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who is Mr. McCain’s closest friend in the chamber. “But Washington now reflects what’s going on in the country, rather than leading it.”\n\nAnother McCain protégée, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, said she treasured how Mr. McCain treated her when they went on the congressional delegation trips he loves and foreign leaders would attempt to recognize the male lawmakers before her.\n\n“They’d always look to Lindsey next,” Ms. Klobuchar said of the heads of state, referring to Mr. Graham, a frequent travel companion of Mr. McCain. “But he’d always say, ‘Senator Klobuchar is the Democratic lead and she’ll be going next.’”\n\nMr. McCain’s has been a lifetime of restlessness, beginning with the childhood relocations of his Navy family and evolving into unceasing demands of “what else?” aimed at his Senate staff. But the man whose political career took flight after he fended off charges of carpetbagging — by noting the longest he had lived in one place was as a prisoner of war — has found a measure of contentment on his ranch.\n\nMr. Biden said he was struck by how solicitous Mr. McCain was of him, inquiring about how he coped with the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer. Yet the former vice president said he was the one who hoped to impart a message.\n\n“I wanted to let him know how much I love him and how much he matters to me and how much I admire his integrity and his courage,” Mr. Biden said.\n\nThen he became more succinct. “I wanted to see my friend,” he said.","author":"Jonathan Martin","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T15:00:59.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/us/politics/06mccain1/06mccain1-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"6dTW1KXTs6QgLCMCpQwxZA==\n"}

Protesters packed Pushkin Square in the center of the city nevertheless, and they were met by columns of riot police who charged into the crowd to try to disperse it.\n\nAcross the country, 1,348 people were detained in 21 cities, with about half in the capital, according to the protest-monitoring website OVD-Info.\n\n“They’re even worse than bandits — the people in power have made this country unfit for living,” said 58-year-old Natalia Znaminskaya, 58, editor of a regional journal in the Moscow suburbs. “No one can survive with these salaries, and in this environment.”\n\nNavalny’s team organized 90 protests across the country, dubbing them “He is not our czar,” a reference to Putin, who was first elected president in 2000 and is already Russia’s longest serving leader since Stalin.\n\nImages from cities as far-flung as Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga River, Krasnoyarsk in Siberia and Khabarovsk in the Far East showed hundreds or thousands of protesters. They chanted “Russia without Putin,” “Putin is a thief” and “Out with the czar!” In St. Petersburg, hundreds walked down Nevsky Prospekt, the city’s central thoroughfare.\n\nIn Russia, protests must receive the green light from authorities to go ahead, and Saturday’s rallies were no exception. Authorities in many places, including Moscow, denied permits. In the Russian capital, the whine of police sirens and the chanting crowds clashed with a nearby outdoor international music festival organized by the city, where performers sang a cappella to a small audience.\n\nThe protests captured the duality of the political mood in Russia ahead of Putin’s inauguration on Monday to a fourth term. Saturday’s rallies were smaller than the ones that preceded Putin’s last inauguration, in 2012, when some 100,000 turned out in Moscow alone in a wave of winter and spring protests. But the protests also showed the determination of Navalny’s sizable number of core supporters, many of them young, who are still willing to risk detention and police violence to make their voices heard.\n\n“We don’t have the hope that we’ll make Russia wonderful and prosperous overnight,” Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s chief of staff, said on the Navalny team’s live YouTube broadcast encouraging people to join the protests. “The sum of our efforts must match the efforts of those evil people, and then, gradually, we will be able to bend the situation in our direction.”\n\nBut polls show Putin still has the support of most Russians of all age groups, who see him as a guarantor of prosperity, stability and security in the face of an increasingly threatening West. A recent survey showed people’s readiness to participate in protests at the lowest level since 2010.\n\n“I’m not too sure what the protesters want, but, economically, we’re fine,” said a 37-year-old business analyst who would only give her first name, Olga, who happened upon the Moscow rally on her regular weekend walk. “Since Crimea reunited with Russia, and we were hit with sanctions, we’ve proven that we’re able to stand on our own two feet.”\n\nNavalny, whose fate after being detained Saturday wasn’t immediately clear, was barred from running for president against Putin earlier this year and has no clear avenue for gaining elected office.\n\nStill, despite having no access through state TV, he has built a following by producing viral videos spotlighting corruption among Russia’s ruling elite and describes street protests as the only way to put pressure on the Kremlin. He has built up a network of offices across the country and has staged several nationwide protests over the past year.\n\nHis arrest is the latest act of government repression of dissent — that along with perceived corruption and a stagnant and sanctions-hit economy — is helping to fuel the protests. Thousands protested in Moscow last Monday against the government’s effort to block access to the Telegram messaging app.\n\nFatigue with Putin is another factor motivating the opposition. His new presidential term will keep him in office until 2024, and Moscow is rife with speculation that the 65-year-old Putin will seek to remain in power for as long as he lives.\n\n“I’m not actually very political, as a person, I have no allegiance to any party, but fighting corruption is important,” said a 26-year-old programmer at the Moscow rally, who would only give his first name, Alexander. “Judging that the same man has been in power for the duration of my life, I can’t not protest.”\n\nSanctions, Syria hit home in Russia, but people aren’t turning against Putin\n\nAs arrests of protesters soar in Russia, this small monitoring group struggles to keep track\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T14:50:13.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pFdZ2c5OCXlsDWg516vtxfkhvNU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XNLCAWCQOII6RBFAIWFBVKNMBI.jpg","digest":"09WmHTAaikPLP+KBGjKeog==\n"}

They will also discuss the U.S. president's own upcoming summit with the North Korean leader, a statement said.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump expressed a preference for holding the \"big event\" with Kim in the demilitarized zone or DMZ between the two Koreas, where Moon and Kim met. He also said Singapore was in contention to host what will be the first summit of between a U.S. and a North Korean leader.\n\n\"We now have a date and we have a location. We'll be announcing it soon,\" Trump told reporters Friday from the White House South Lawn before departing for Dallas. He's previously said the summit was planned for May or early June.\n\nA meeting with Kim seemed an outlandish possibility just a few months ago when the two leaders were trading threats and insults over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. But momentum for diplomacy has built this year as the rival Koreas have patched up ties. In March, Trump unexpectedly accepted an offer of talks from Kim after the North Korean dictator agreed to suspend nuclear and ballistic missile tests and discuss \"denuclearization.\"\n\nAccording to South Korea, Kim has said he'd be willing to give up his nukes if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and pledges not to attack the North. But his exact demands for relinquishing weapons that his nation spent decades building remains unclear.\n\nTrump said that withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea is \"not on the table.\" Some 28,500 U.S. forces are based in the allied nation, a military presence that has been preserved to deter North Korea since the war ended in 1953 without a peace treaty.\n\n\"Now I have to tell you, at some point into the future, I would like to save the money,\" Trump said later as he prepared to board Air Force One. \"You know we have 32,000 troops there but I think a lot of great things will happen but troops are not on the table. Absolutely.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump has asked the Pentagon to prepare options plans for drawing down American troops. It cited unnamed officials as saying that wasn't intended to be a bargaining chip with Kim, but did reflect that a prospective peace treaty between the Koreas could diminish the need for U.S. forces in South Korea.\n\nAt the inter-Korean summit last Friday, held on the southern side of the DMZ, Moon and Kim pledged to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons and seek a formal end this year to the Korean conflict where the opposing sides remain technically at war more than six decades after fighting halted with an armistice.\n\nBut for Trump to contemplate withdrawing troops now would be a quixotic move as he enters into negotiations with Kim whose demands and intentions are uncertain. Two weeks ago, shortly before the inter-Korean summit, Moon said that Kim actually wasn't insisting on a longstanding demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as a precondition for abandoning his nukes.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, who met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong in Washington on Friday, called the Times report \"utter nonsense.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump complained that South Korea does not do enough to financially support the American military commitment. In March, Washington and Seoul began negotiations on how much South Korea should offset the costs of the deployment in the coming years. Under the current agreement that expires at the end of 2018, the South provides about $830 million per year.\n\nBefore Trump meets Kim, Washington is looking for North Korea to address another persistent source of tension between the adversaries: the detention of three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state of activities in the North.\n\nTrump hinted that the release of Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim was in the offing, but again was sparing on the details.\n\n\"We're having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages, and I think you're going to see very good things. As I said yesterday, stay tuned,\" Trump said, referring to an earlier tweet on the issue.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

InSight is the first-ever interplanetary mission to launch from the U.S. West Coast.","title":"NASA's InSight Mars Lander Launches to Probe Red Planet's Deep Interior","url":"https://www.space.com/40498-nasa-mars-insight-lander-launch.html","text":"VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. — NASA's latest Mars explorer is on its way to the Red Planet.\n\nThe agency's InSight Mars lander lifted off today (May 5) atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, rising off a pad here at 7:05 a.m. EDT (1105 GMT, 4:05 a.m. local California time) and disappearing into the thick predawn fog moments later.\n\n\"This is a big day. We're going back to Mars,\" NASA's new administrator Jim Bridenstine, who took charge of the agency last month, said in a congratulatory call to the InSight team after launch. \"This is an extraordinary mission with a whole host of firsts.\" [Launch Photos: See NASA's InSight Soar Toward Mars]\n\nInSight is the first interplanetary mission ever to launch from the West Coast and NASA's first Mars surface craft to lift off since the Curiosity rover started its deep-space journey in November 2011.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, InSight will reach its destination in a little less than seven months, touching down Nov. 26 on a nice, flat plain just north of the Martian equator. After a series of checkouts, the stationary lander will then begin a mission unlike any ever undertaken in the annals of planetary exploration.\n\nInSight \"will probe the interior of another terrestrial planet, giving us an idea of the size of the core, the mantle, the crust — and our ability then to compare that with the Earth,\" NASA Chief Scientist Jim Green said during a prelaunch news conference on Thursday (May 3). \"This is of fundamental importance for us to understand the origin of our solar system and how it became the way it is today.\"\n\nTwo briefcase-size satellites also hitched a ride on this morning's launch and will make their own way to Mars, in an attempt to become the first-ever interplanetary \"cubesats.\" The probe is also carrying a chip with 2.4 million names from space fans, including \"Star Trek's\" Captain Kirk William Shatner, who signed up to send their names to Mars.\n\nNASA officials have compared InSight — whose name is short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport — to a doctor performing a long-overdue checkup. [NASA's InSight Mars Lander: 10 Wild Facts]\n\nFor example, the solar-powered lander will take Mars' temperature using a heat probe that will hammer itself about 16 feet (4.9 meters) beneath the red dirt. And InSight will monitor the planet's pulse, detecting vibrations caused by \"marsquakes,\" meteorite strikes and other events, all using an ultraprecise seismometer called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS).\n\n\"Ultraprecise\" is no exaggeration: SEIS will be capable of spotting vibrations smaller than a hydrogen atom, mission team members have said. The instrument must therefore be encased in a vacuum chamber, so its observations aren't swamped by environmental noise.\n\nInSight will place SEIS directly on the ground using the lander's robotic arm, and then place a shield over SEIS to block wind and dampen temperature variations. That's another first that this mission will achieve: Other Mars robots have generally kept their scientific gear close, and none have deployed an instrument using their arms in this way.\n\n\"It's a first-time event, so we're always concerned about that,\" Chuck Scott, InSight flight system manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, told Space.com.\n\nBut the InSight team has done \"an extreme amount of testing\" here on Earth to prepare for the milestone deployment, Scott added, so the team isn't unduly worried.\n\nSEIS and the heat probe — which is known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) — are InSight's main scientific instruments. But the mission will perform another experiment using the lander's communications gear.\n\nDuring this investigation, known as the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), scientists will track InSight's location precisely — to within 1 foot (0.3 m). This work will allow team members to detect tiny wobbles in Mars' axis of rotation, which should reveal key insights about the planet's core, including its size.\n\nAnalysis of the HP3 and SEIS data will also shed light on Mars' interior, including the thickness of the planet's crust and the structure and dynamics of Mars' mantle. Taken together, this information will help researchers better understand how rocky planets form and evolve, mission team members have said.\n\nWe can't look to our own planet for such information, because Earth's roiling insides have erased the evidence of what happened long ago. The long-dead moon does preserve such evidence, but our natural satellite is so much smaller than Earth that the processes that occurred inside each world in the ancient past are very different, said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt, of JPL. [InSight in Pictures: NASA's Mission to Probe Mars's Core]\n\n\"So, Mars is kind of a unique opportunity. We call it the Goldilocks planet — it's not too big, it's not too small, it's just right,\" Banerdt said during Thursday's news conference.\n\n\"It's actually undergone the processes of planetary differentiation that the Earth did,\" he added. \"But about maybe 20 [million] to 50 million years after it was formed, it just kind of stopped. We have lots of geology going on on the surface, but all those fingerprints of those early processes are still retained in the deep interior. And so, that's why we want to go measure the fundamental parameters of the deep interior.\"\n\nThe mission's data could also be a boon to future human exploration on Mars, Green said. \"How quake-prone is Mars? That's fundamental information that we need to know as humans then explore Mars,\" he said. [How Will a Human Mars Base Work? NASA's Vision in Images]\n\nThe HP3 data may also reveal temperature differentials that humans could harness to heat habitats, Green added.\n\n\"This mission does so many fundamental things, not only in planetary science but in human exploration,\" he said.\n\nInSight was originally supposed to launch in March 2016. In advance of that date, NASA and the mission team decided to launch from here, on the central California coast, rather than the usual site for interplanetary missions, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\n\nLaunching from the East Coast offers a distinct advantage for such missions: Rockets get an extra push from Earth's rotation, which is going in the \"right\" direction. But Cape Canaveral was forecast to be pretty busy in early 2016, and the InSight team wanted to avoid congestion. So, they picked Vandenberg. And InSight is light enough, and the Atlas V powerful enough, to overcome the Earth-rotation issue, mission team members said.\n\nThe launch-site decision held even after InSight failed to hit the original window. In late 2015, the mission team detected a tiny leak in SEIS' vacuum chamber — so tiny that it would take 50 years to lower the pressure by 1 lb. per square inch in a car tire, Banerdt said.\n\nBut SEIS' need for precision is so great that the team had to fix the leak. And they couldn't do so properly before the 2016 launch window ended, so InSight's liftoff was pushed back more than two years. (Mars and Earth align favorably for interplanetary missions just once every 26 months.)\n\nThe fix and the delay added $154 million to the mission's price tag, NASA officials said in 2016. U.S. investment in the mission is now $814 million, with about $163 million of that total going to launch services, according to NASA officials.\n\nFrance and Germany have contributed an additional $180 million, mostly to develop SEIS and HP3. The French space agency, CNES, provided SEIS for the mission, and the German space agency, DLR, built HP3.\n\nNASA and JPL ponied up another $18.5 million for those two cubesats. The duo are officially known as MarCO-A and MarCO-B (\"MarCO\" being short for \"Mars Cube One\"), but their developers have dubbed them Wall-E and Eva. That's because the cubesats' propulsion system uses compressed R236FA gas, which is the propellant in many fire extinguishers — and in the 2008 movie \"Wall-E,\" the eponymous, trash-compacting robot famously used a fire extinguisher to zoom around space. (Eva was Wall-E's friend in the film.)\n\nWall-E and Eva (the cubesats) are tasked with a demonstration mission: to show that cubesats, which to date have stuck close to Earth, can journey to other planets. The plan calls for the two tiny satellites to fly by Mars as InSight arrives for its crucial entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence. Wall-E and Eva will attempt to beam EDL data from the lander back to controllers here on Earth, but it won't be a disaster for InSight if the cubesats fail to pull it off. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will perform the relay work regardless. [Latest Photos from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]\n\nMarCO team members will assess the health of Wall-E and Eva within a few weeks of the Mars flyby, and that will be the end of the cubesats' mission.\n\nInSight, of course, will just be getting started at that point; the lander's prime science mission is designed to last until Nov. 24, 2020.\n\nThe main body of the 790-lb. (358 kilograms) InSight is based heavily off NASA's Phoenix lander, which landed near the Martian north pole in May 2008 (and found water ice just beneath the surface shortly thereafter). InSight will also employ Phoenix's landing technique, relying on parachutes and engine firings to slow itself enough for a soft and safe touchdown on the Red Planet (as opposed to the much heavier Curiosity, which also used parachutes but was lowered to the surface on cables by a rocket-powered \"sky crane\").\n\nAnd InSight's avionics and other electronics borrow from the agency's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter, which has been circling the Red Planet since September 2014.\n\nLeveraging such heritage hardware is a way to save money and reduce risk. And Mars missions are still risky, despite the lengthy run of success that NASA has enjoyed at the Red Planet recently. That active six-mission streak of safe arrivals runs from the Mars Odyssey orbiter, which reached the Red Planet in October 2001, through MAVEN's orbital insertion.\n\n\"Mars is hard,\" said Tim Linn, InSight deputy program manager and EDL manager at aerospace company Lockheed Martin, which built the spacecraft for NASA.\n\n\"It's one of the neatest things we do, but it's still really hard,\" Linn told Space.com.","author":"Mike Wall","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T11:35:11.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Space.com"},"urlToImage":"https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA3Ni8xNjAvb3JpZ2luYWwvaW5zaWdodC1tYXJzLWxhdW5jaC0yLmpwZw==","digest":"i923SSIf7du6KyYv1PoRuQ==\n"}

In fact, the holiday had its origin more than 50 years after the date associated with the country’s independence. So here’s what you need to know about Cinco de Mayo, including its evolution into a major economic driver for business owners and beverage companies across the United States.\n\nCinco de Mayo, which isn’t widely celebrated in Mexico, commemorates an underdog victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The victory was galvanizing for the Mexican forces — and for those supporting them from afar — but it was short-lived, as France later occupied Mexico for a few years. Still, Cinco de Mayo continued to be celebrated in Puebla and, perhaps more significantly, by Mexican-Americans north of the border.\n\nThe country’s Independence Day is Sept. 16, now a national holiday. On that day in 1810, a priest named Miguel Hidalgo implored Mexico to revolt against Spain, leading to the War for Independence, which ended in 1821.\n\nIn the early 1960s, many Mexican-American activists entrenched in the country’s growing civil rights movement used the day as a source of pride. Close to two decades later, in 1989, an ad campaign by an importer of beers like Modelo and Corona was introduced around the day. The campaign was initially targeted toward Latinos but eventually broadened with print and TV ads. This year, Corona’s website featured a ticking “Countdown to Corona de Mayo” in the hours leading up to May 5.\n\nThe commercialization of Cinco de Mayo (and criticism of cultural stereotypes) has taken off. The research firm Nielsen reported that in 2013 Americans bought more than $600 million worth of beer for Cinco de Mayo, more than for the Super Bowl or St. Patrick’s Day.","author":"Claudio E.

Mueller III’s investigation. He was going to iron out the terms for a Trump interview by the special counsel and barring that he was going to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions to kill the probe. But before the ink could dry on Giuliani’s new business cards, he entered a different theater of political war—the Stormy Daniels dispute—and napalmed whatever credibility he still had as a counselor, a tactician and broker by shooting his mouth off to the press about the case.\n\nPrior to Giuliani’s arrival, the Stormy Daniels story was a confusing mess of secret payouts, denials, lawsuits, and Michael Avenatti apperances on CNN. But thanks to his efforts to set the record straight in interviews on Hannity and interviews with BuzzFeed, the Washington Post, NBC News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and elsewhere, the official Trump account of the Daniels saga has coiled and recoiled on itself like so many knotted strands of DNA that nobody can claim to understand what happened. In his new timeline of events, Giuliani explicitly stated that the Daniels payment was timed to influence the election. “Imagine if [the Daniel tryst allegation] came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani told the Fox \u0026 Friends gang on Thursday.\n\nThe president, who had previously denied all knowledge of the Stormy Daniels payments—“You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney and you’ll have to ask Michael Cohen,” he said on Air Force One on April 5—intervened on Friday morning to erase the Giuliani confusion by feeding the press corps Jell-O shooters of fresh perplexity.\n\n“Virtually everything said has been said incorrectly,” Trump told the press. “Rudy is a great guy, but he just started a day ago,” he explained, making his lawyer, who actually started two weeks ago, sound like a summer intern. “But he really has his heart into it. He’s working hard. He’s learning the subject matter.” Further signaling that Giuliani was full of beans, Trump promised, “He’ll get his facts straight.”\n\nBut when will Trump get his facts straight? On Friday evening, the New York Times broke news—surprising nobody—that he had lied lied lied about not knowing about the payouts to Daniels. He had known for “months” before he made the now-famous Air Force One denial.\n\nGiuliani attempted a bit of “fact-straightening“ with a Friday afternoon statement that couched and snipped what he had already said. “There was no campaign violation,” he stated unequivocally because the payment to Daniels would have been made whether Trump had been a candidate or not. He retreated from his earlier omniscience, now asserting that he spoke not of the “President’s knowledge” of the Stormy Daniel episode—even though he talked to Trump about it—but only his “understanding of these matters.”\n\nRudy didn’t completely neglect the Russia business, but by week’s end Trump wished that he had. In a bit of rowback, Giuliani told Sean Hannity that Trump had fired FBI Director James B. Comey “because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.” (Recall that Trump himself told NBC News’ Lester Holt in May 2017 that he fired Comey because “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” Presumably chastised by Trump’s people for this “mischaracterization,” Giuliani issued a “clarifying” statement, averring that the justification for the sacking was Article II of the Constitution, the one that gives the president the power to appoint whom he wants.\n\nNobody came closer to singing the “Two Trumps” theme to the top of the charts than the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake, who looked up from tangled mess of assertions, abjurations, and buffoonery to warble, “Giuliani is a uniquely Trumpian blend of confidence and lack of discipline.”\n\nGiuliani’s belly flop won’t be more than a footnote when they write the history of the special counsel’s investigation of Russian meddling, but it deserves our savoring if only because it demonstrates the rigor with which Trump addresses his legal problems, his political crises and the historical record. Trump and his allies seem incapable of telling a consistent story—or even of sticking to the stories they tell. Remember how Trump tried to explain away the Trump Tower meeting of June 2016 as being a session about “Russian adoption.” Or recall how his account of the number of his days he spent in Moscow during the Miss Universe pageant, days chronicled in the Steele Dossier, keeps shifting. Or think about how his aides routinely dismiss as “jokes” the startling things he says from the podium—such as his request during the campaign that Russia hack and release Hillary Clinton’s emails.\n\nEven Trump’s supporters in conservative media have begun to question his gyrations. On Fox News Channel, anchor Neil Cavuto tore into himthis week stating, “You’re the president. You’re busy. I’m just having a devil of a time figuring out which news is fake. Let’s just say your own words on lots of stuff give me, shall I say, lots of pause.” The editorialists at the Wall Street Journal let him have it with the other barrel, predicting that Trump’s continued lies “increase the likelihood that few will believe him during a genuine crisis,” like a clash in North Korea or the findings of Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump and Giuliani’s scheming has turned a tiny turd of embarrassment into an epic dunghill. This inability to resolve the Stormy Daniels matter peaceably—an indiscretion his supporters would forgive and overlook if he asked them—predicts maximum chaos when the strong meat of Mueller’s report lands. Prepare yourself for the greatest Trumpian contradiction, rowback, obfuscation and distortion ever recorded.\n\nAbout That “Expensive Painting” … In last week’s “Swamp Diary,” I noted that the House Intelligence Committee's found that oligarch Aras Agalarov gave an “expensive painting” to Trump and asked readers to speculate on what it might depict. Scores of readers guessed that it was of prostitutes peeing on the Moscow hotel bed while Trump watched, a scene reported in the Steele Dossier. Here follows an assortment of more original speculations: Dennis Benjamin: A portrait of a smoking gun; Angie: Hillary behind bars; Robert Epstein: A water color of beautiful Russian showers; Rajiv Pandey: Trump kissing Putin’s feet; David Langlois: A shirtless Putin giving a naked Trump a piggyback ride; Benjamin Contreras: Trump in Putin’s pocket; Jonathan Granoff: A copy of “The Scream”; Ann Hobbs: Putin presenting Trump with Hillary Clinton’s head on a silver platter.\n\nSend untrue statements and other corrections of the record to Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

In bronze. By way of China. And, oh, he’s now 18 feet tall.\n\nThe unveiling of a two-ton Chinese-funded sculpture to honor the German philosopher on the 200th anniversary of his birth brought scads of tourists to Trier, where his life began.\n\nWhile here, they took in Marx lectures, toured the Marx family home and bought vast quantities of marked-up Marx souvenirs. (The Marx rubber duckies — wild gray mane framing bright orange bill — were a particular hit.)\n\nThe capitalist exploitation of his birthday may not have thrilled the author of the Communist Manifesto. But the proponent of proletarian uprisings might have been cheered by another facet of the celebration: the struggle. Not of the class variety. But a bitter one, nonetheless.\n\n[The four most ridiculously capitalist souvenirs for sale at Marx’s birthday party]\n\nThe city is split over whether a democratic nation such as Germany should be erecting monuments that are paid for, designed and built by an authoritarian one such as China. The divide spilled into the streets Saturday with dueling demonstrations for and against the monolith, forming a noisy backdrop to the statue’s official dedication.\n\nOn one side, hundreds of flag-waving members of Germany’s fringe Communist Party cheered. On the other — separated by barricades and riot police — an eclectic group of Free Tibet, anti-fascist and pro-human rights protesters chanted and blew whistles in a vain effort to drown out the speeches.\n\nCity officials say they see nothing wrong with the statue’s unusual path to Trier’s downtown. The statue, Trier Mayor Wolfram Leibe insisted Saturday, is not about the “glorification” of Marx. Instead, he told the large crowd that had assembled under a cloudless blue sky, it’s meant to spark conversation — and strengthen international bonds.\n\n“It’s a gesture of friendship,” he said.\n\nBut others in Germany — a nation divided for nearly a half-century due in no small part to its native son’s theories — say city officials are being naive about a project that neatly aligns with Chinese state propaganda.\n\n“There’s no doubt that there’s a political agenda behind it,” said Christian Soffel, a Chinese studies professor at Trier University.\n\nHow important Marx is to that agenda was underlined by the visit of two senior Chinese officials who spoke at Saturday’s ceremony. The officials — the country’s ambassador to Germany and the deputy chief of the Information Ministry, the government’s propaganda arm — each paid tribute to Marx, though not in terribly Marxian terms.\n\nThe ambassador, Shi Mingde, said China had “modernized” Marx’s theories — a veiled reference to the country’s hearty embrace of much of modern capitalism — and boasted that China is responsible for 30 percent of global economic growth.\n\n“For that,” he said, “we can thank Karl Marx.”\n\nAt the unveiling’s critical moment, Chinese and German officials together pulled back a red drape to reveal a rendering of Marx in full stride — a book clutched beneath his left arm, his right gently pressed to his signature frock coat.\n\nChina had already held its own lavish event to honor the bicentennial. On Friday, President Xi Jinping heralded Marx as “the greatest thinker of modern times” at a ceremony to mark his birthday at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nXi, who recently pushed through constitutional changes that could allow him to stay in office indefinitely, has urged all Communist Party members to read Marx and adopt his theories as “a way of life.”\n\nXi’s German counterpart, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, showed markedly less affection with his own speech about Marx on Thursday. The philosopher was undeniably influential, Steinmeier said, and his ideas need to be discussed. But the country also cannot forget that his writings gave fuel to murderous regimes — and still do.\n\n“We shouldn’t fear Marx, but we don’t need to build any golden statues to him either,” Steinmeier said.\n\nNot so long ago, Germany was tearing down statues of Marx. An icon of communist East Germany, his likeness was scrubbed from many a town square after the country’s reunification under democracy and capitalism in 1990.\n\nAnd that is the way it should stay, said Dieter Dombrowski, who spent 20 months in an East German prison after getting caught trying to flee the country.\n\n“Marx wrote the cookbook for communist dictatorships all over the world,” said Dombrowski, who now chairs an organization that advocates on behalf of those who were victims of such regimes.\n\nHe called the decision by Trier, in far western Germany, to allow China to build an enormous Marx statue “tragic and laughable all at once.”\n\n“In Trier, and in the West as a whole, no one read Marx. They don’t have a sense for the history,” he said. “It was all far away from them. But we know both his theories and how they were put into practice.”\n\nWhether Marx would have approved of how his theories have been applied is the subject of fierce debate. Many defenders insist he should not be held responsible for the way his ideas were distorted for murderous ends decades after his death. And love him or hate him, there’s no denying that the problems he identified — particularly the tendency of capitalism to create conflict between classes — remain relevant two centuries later.\n\n“The gap between rich and poor is getting wider — not only here in Germany, but in the U.S. and in many other countries,” said Wolfgang Bergmann, a retired locksmith whose billowing white hair and beard make him a dead ringer for the long-dead philosopher.\n\nBergmann was drawn to Trier for the statue unveiling because of his own political convictions. “I’ve been a communist since 1971,” he said proudly.\n\nBut Bergmann is relatively rare in Germany, particularly in Trier — a heavily Catholic and somewhat conservative city where residents have no taste for revolution.\n\nThe same was true in Marx’s day.\n\nHaving been raised in a middle-class family in a stately Baroque home, he left to attend university at 17 and never moved back. Much of his life was spent in exile, where his radical writings advocating the violent overthrow of the capitalist system were better tolerated than they would have in his native land. He died in London and was buried there.\n\nModern-day Trier, with a population just north of 100,000, reflects little evidence that Marx’s ideas had much impact locally. Icons of capitalism — McDonald’s hamburgers, luxury watches, designer clothing brands — are on sale in the grand central square. Marx’s boyhood home, meanwhile, has become a “euro store,” where everything from Chinese-made flip-flops to sunglasses can be purchased with loose change. The Marx statue itself stares out at a hair salon.\n\nThe city has long been conflicted about the Marx legacy — a conflict well represented in the bookstore window across the street from the home where he was born. Unlike the home where he was raised, the bookstore has been converted into a museum.\n\nOwner Regina Ebel has assembled in the window a motley collection of Marx books, Marx busts and even an antique that she claims, with a wink, could be Marx’s baby carriage. But she also has a cage stuffed with books and sealed with red tape — a protest against Marx-inspired oppression.\n\nHer own views are similarly ambivalent.\n\nShe would not mind a Marx statue in town. It’s just the size that bothers her.\n\n“A statue on a human scale is fine,” she said. “But this is propaganda.”\n\nIf the tourists who have descended on Trier have any such concerns, it hasn’t shown. Many are Chinese, and Soffel, the professor, said he believes the city’s true goal in allowing the statue to be built is to up their number.\n\n“For a city like Trier, which has no real industry aside from wine and tourism, it’s quite attractive to draw more Chinese,” he said.\n\nEarly indications suggest the strategy is working. At Trier Souvenir, around the corner from the spot where the statue was unveiled, the shop was doing a brisk business Saturday in all things Marx.\n\nThe ducks were going fast at 6.90 euros apiece. The “zero euro” souvenir bank notes, adorned with Marx’s stern visage and selling for three euros, had sold out — but they could still be preordered. Marx mouse pads, coffee cups and refrigerator magnets were also in demand.\n\nIn between ringing up sales, 24-year-old Sarah Klein said she had not given much thought to the statue debate or to what Marx would make of it all.\n\nBut she was sure of one thing: “It’s going to be good for business.”\n\nXi praises Marxism as a tool for China to ‘win the future’\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"https://www.facebook.com/griff.witte","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T10:03:23.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SMr797AI8kGsdu_XhhdLi7B4W-I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXODHHCQBAI6RL2GWHLNYDM37Y.jpg","digest":"5XrTs58zn6EuORUTJIHxWg==\n"}

The Honduran government is expressing regret over a U.S. move to end temporary protected status for tens of thousands of the Central American nation’s citizens residing in the United States. (Fernando Antonio/Associated Press)\n\nTEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — President Juan Orlando Hernandez’s government expressed regret over a U.S. move Friday to end temporary protected status, or TPS, for tens of thousands of Hondurans who have resided in the United States for nearly two decades.\n\nThe foreign relations ministry said in a statement that it is a sovereign matter for Washington to decide, but added that “we deeply lament it.”\n\nIt said returnees “are and always will be welcome in their homeland, where they will be received with open arms,” and “their reintegration into our society will be facilitated.”\n\nThe Trump administration announced earlier in the day that it was ending TPS for the 57,000 Hondurans covered under the program. They now have until Jan. 5, 2020, to sort out their affairs before returning home — or try to normalize their migratory status in other ways, such as through marriage or sponsorship.\n\nThe figure represents a small fraction of the estimated 1.1 million-plus Hondurans living in the United States, who each year send home remittances totaling some $4.2 billion, or nearly one-sixth of Honduras’ $26 billion gross domestic product.\n\nStill, Hugo Noe, a former Central Bank president and ex-Honduran ambassador to Washington, called the decision “a tragedy that creates uncertainty for so many families.”\n\n“Those Hondurans will fall into illegal status,” Noe predicted. “They will not come back.”\n\nHondurans covered by TPS join hundreds of thousands of other immigrants from countries battered by violence and natural disasters who are losing permission to be in the United States. In recent months the Department of Homeland Security has also ended protected status for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan and Nepal.\n\nTPS was granted for Hondurans after Hurricane Mitch devastated the country, particularly its agricultural sector, in 1998.\n\nHonduras, afflicted by poverty and inequality, regularly posts homicide rates that are among the world’s highest amid rampant gang violence. It is also seen as politically unstable following a 2009 coup and Hernandez’s re-election last year in a vote that was marred by irregularities and denounced by some as fraudulent.\n\nOverall the country is worse off than it was nearly two decades ago post-hurricane, said Michael Allison, a political scientist specializing in Central America at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania.\n\n“The status of democracy in the country is clearly in doubt with the election of Hernandez and the repression of protesters that has taken place since the election,” Allison said. “The gang violence is much, much worse than it was 20 years ago. ... Drug trafficking and organized crime have really taken off since the 2009 coup against (Manuel) Zelaya as well. It’s tough to say things are better.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But officials say nothing is different about the year but the numbers.\n\nA transparency report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shows numerous other fluctuations in the volume of surveillance conducted. Foreign surveillance-related, warrantless Section 702 content queries involving U.S. persons jumped from 5,288 to 7,512, for instance, and more citizens were “unmasked,” indicating a general increase in quantity.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of more invasive pen register/trace and tap orders dropped by nearly half, to 33, with even fewer targets — far less than the peak in 2014, when 135 orders targeted 516 people.\n\nThe biggest increase by far is the number of “call detail records” collected from service providers. Although the number of targets actually decreased from the previous year, from 42 to 40, the number of call records jumped from 151 million to 534 million, and search terms from 22,360 to 31,196.\n\nCall detail records are things like which numbers were called and when, the duration of the call and so on — metadata, no content. But metadata can be just as revealing as content, since it can, for example, place a person near the scene of a crime, or establish that two people were connected even if the conversation they had was benign.\n\nWhat do these increases mean? It’s hard to say. A spokesperson for the ODNI told Reuters that the government “has not altered the manner in which it uses its authority to obtain call detail records,” and that they “expect this number to fluctuate from year to year.” So according to them, it’s just a matter of quantity.\n\nBecause one target can yield hundreds or thousands of incidental sub-targets — people connected to the target whose call records will be requested and stored — it’s possible that 2017’s targets just had fatter, longer contact lists and deeper networks than 2016’s. Needless to say this explanation is unsatisfying.\n\nAlthough the NSA’s surveillance apparatus was dealt a check with the 2013 Snowden leaks and subsequent half-hearted crackdowns by lawmakers, it clearly is getting back into its stride.","author":"Devin Coldewey","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T00:24:38.000Z"},"source":{"id":"techcrunch","name":"TechCrunch"},"urlToImage":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-96263974.jpg?w=648","digest":"s8QGi8a4uhjFzvHkMCe9qQ==\n"}

Ellis said Mueller's team seemed to be pursuing the case — which involves bank and tax fraud — in order to \"tighten the screws\" on Manafort, in the hope that he will testify against others including President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I don't see what relation this indictment has with what the special counsel is authorized to investigate,\" Ellis said during an hourlong hearing in Alexandria, Virginia. \"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud. ... What you really care about is what information Mr. Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan went on to colorfully describe what he thinks Mueller's team is up to with the pressure it is putting on Manafort.\n\n“The vernacular is to 'sing,' is what prosecutors use. What you got to be careful of is they may not only sing, they may compose,” Ellis said.\n\nDespite the prickly, often-hostile reception Ellis gave prosecutors Friday, he issued no immediate ruling on a defense motion to toss out the case over Mueller's alleged excesses. At times, the judge suggested he may conclude that Mueller's initial jurisdiction when he was appointed last May was effectively expanded at a later point to cover the case he brought against Manafort in Virginia in February.\n\nSome of the grilling Ellis gave Mueller's team signaled that the judge has been following news coverage of the Trump-Russia probe. The judge questioned why Mueller's office was directly pursuing the bank fraud charges against Manafort, but had handed off an investigation of Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen to prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\n\"Why in New York did you feel it was not necessary to keep that, but it was necessary to keep this bank fraud, which I think manifestly has nothing to do with the campaign?\" Ellis asked. \"Why is New York different?\"\n\nDeputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, a veteran Justice Department lawyer assigned to assist Mueller's office, confirmed that the Mueller team handed off some matters to prosecutors in New York, but suggested they didn't relate to the special counsel's core focus.\n\n\"We take very seriously the primary mission that was assigned to us....We are focused on that mission,\" Dreeben said. \"We are not going off the range that the acting attorney general authorized us to do....We followed the money into the transactions that led to the charges here.\"\n\nEllis said he was wary of the notion that Mueller's team can pursue any case it wishes.\n\n\"What we don't want in this country, we don't want anyone with unfettered power,\" the judge said. \"It's unlikely you're going to persuade me the special counsel has unlimited powers to do anything her or she wants.\"\n\nDuring a trip to Dallas on Friday to address the National Rifle Association, Trump seized on news reports about the skepticism the judge expressed.\n\nCalling the judge “really something special, I hear,” and “a respected person,“ Trump said Ellis validated his view that Mueller's goal was to pressure figures like Manafort to make damaging claims about Trump or others on the campaign.\n\n“I‘ve been saying that for a long time. It‘s a witch hunt,“ the president said, reading a news account of the hearing. “None of that information has to do with Russian government information and the campaign of Donald Trump. It doesn‘t have anything to do. It‘s from years before.“\n\nTrump also offered praise for Manafort, whom he effectively fired in August 2016.\n\n“He was there for a short while but he's a good person, I really believe he's a good person,“ Trump said. “We‘re all fighting battles, but I love fighting these battles. It‘s really a disgrace.“\n\nAt the morning hearing in Alexandria, Ellis suggested on two occasions that the case against Manafort could be reassigned to prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, although it was not clear how seriously he was considering that possibility or whether he thought he had the authority to require such a move.\n\nManafort's defense attorney, Kevin Downing, urged the judge to toss out the indictment or, at least, to demand more documentation from the Justice Department about how Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided to appoint Mueller last May and what was in the special prosecutor's scope at that time.\n\nDowning also encouraged Ellis to reject the Mueller team's arguments that defendants have no right to insist that the Justice Department follow regulations governing the appointment of special prosecutors. He noted that the regulations were published to assure the public about what process would be followed in sensitive cases.\n\n\"It's as if they hoodwinked the entire United States,\" Downing said. \"I don't think that can stand, your honor.\"\n\nEllis seemed to agree that the Justice Department was obliged to abide by its own policy. He urged Dreeben to shift his focus to Rosenstein's May directive. \"I think you're better off arguing it's very broad,\" the judge said.\n\nDreeben insisted that Rosenstein’s May 17 order was not a detailed description of the scope of authority Rosenstein gave to Mueller. However, Dreeben was vague about whether any other written documentation was created on the subject before an August 2 memo that the Justice Department included in heavily-redacted form in a court filing last month.\n\n\"We did acquire the various investigatory threads that relate to Mr. Manafort, upon appointment of the special counsel,\" Dreeben said.\n\nEllis ordered that an unredacted version of that August memo be filed with him within two weeks, although he said it may be submitted under seal and without sharing it with Manafort's defense team.\n\nDreeben said nothing else in the memo related to Manafort, but the judge said he'd decide.\n\n\"I'll be the judge of what relates to the other,\" the judge said curtly.\n\nManafort, a longtime lobbyist and political consultant in the U.S. and abroad, faces two criminal indictments. One case originally filed in Washington, D.C. last October, charges him with money laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine. The case before Ellis, filed in February, charges Manafort with bank fraud, tax evasion and failing to report overseas bank accounts.\n\n\"There’s no mention in the indictment of any Russian individuals or any Russian bank or any payment to Manafort by the Russians,” the judge noted.\n\nDreeben never directly responded to Ellis' suggestion that Mueller's team was trying to pressure Manafort to cooperate against Trump or others.\n\n“Our investigative scope covers the activities that led to this case,” Dreeben said.\n\n“It covers bank fraud in 2005 and 2007?” Ellis replied incredulously, in just one of several instances where the judge snapped at the longtime prosecutor.\n\nAt another point, when Dreeben seemed to be taking too long to address the judge’s point about pressuring Manafort, Ellis interrupted and raised his voice.\n\n“I asked you, where am I wrong about that?” the judge said sternly.\n\nAt another juncture, Ellis chastised some of Mueller’s lawyers for nodding while at the counsel table. \"Don't nod or shake your head,\" he told them, adding later, \"Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal.\"\n\nMueller's team, who appeared unaccompanied at a hearing in March, were joined Friday by an Alexandria-based public corruption and financial crimes prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye.\n\nEllis seemed pleased with that development. \"I indicated the special counsel should have local counsel.

Already, this year's postseason has run the gamut, from a surplus of controversial hits to the head (and trying to justify them) to a publicly-sanctioned spitting investigation into Sidney Crosby.\n\nBut the strangest has been Bruins heel Brad Marchand's newfound desire to lick his opponents.\n\nIn the wake of Friday's Game 4, the scene of Marchand's second such display of PDA in the first two rounds of Boston's playoff run, the NHL served notice to players — and the Bruins heel, specifically — to keep their tongues to themselves or face consequences.\n\nGOLDEN STANDARD\n\nHow Vegas became the most successful expansion team in sports history\n\nMarchand's antics began in Game 1 of the first round against the Maple Leafs when, in the heat of a scuffle with Leo Komarov, he nuzzled the Toronto tough guy, smooching his neck. The quirky incident led to laughs from observers around the league, who mostly agreed with Nazem Kadri's assessment that \"it was uncomfortable to watch.\"\n\nAt the time, reports said the NHL gave Marchand a tongue-lashing for the outburst, but the league later shot down those claims.\n\nTrue to form, that pest reputation has preceded Marchand into the second round against the Lightning.\n\nWith the Bruins trailing in the second period Friday, he became involved in a skirmish with Tampa's Ryan Callahan. Marchand landed a low-bridge hit on Callahan along the boards earlier in the game. So when Callahan confronted Marchand — shoving him in the face — the Bruin responded by licking Callahan's sweaty, bearded cheek (ew).\n\n\"Well, he punched me four times in the face, so, you know, he just kept getting close,\" Marchand said after the game, a 4-3 Boston loss. \"Nothing big.\"\n\nCallahan was none too pleased.\n\n\"I don't know what the difference is between that and spitting in someone's face,\" he told reporters. \"I hope the league looks at it. I don't know if there is discipline for spitting in someone's face. But for me it's worse, if not the same.\"\n\nThe NHL's threat of supplemental discipline should be enough to curtail such behavior for the rest of the playoffs. Marchand, of course, is no stranger to being reprimanded for his actions on the ice. He was suspended five games earlier this season for elbowing the Devils' Marcus Johansson, a ban that bridged the NHL's All-Star break in Tampa where Marchand, allowed to participate in the festivities, was heartily booed and embraced his villain roll, repeatedly egging on the crowd.\n\nHe was also fined on two separate occasions in March, the first for embellishment and another for elbowing the Islanders' Andrew MacDonald.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:14:48.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Sportingnews.com"},"urlToImage":"http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/60/60/brad-marchand-050518-getty-ftrjpg_1m824rt5pjbzb1basje86f3w3t.jpg?t=825117083","digest":"R++5yMOmX5IgDR0MQQAGdQ==\n"}

Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously\n\n“The United States strongly objects to China’s attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content,” the White House said in its statement. “We call on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens.”\n\nThe sharp criticism comes on the heels of contentious trade talks with China earlier this week.\n\nThe Trump administration demanded a $200 billion cut in China’s trade surplus with the United States by 2020, sharply lower tariffs and a halt to subsidies for advanced technology, people familiar with the talks said on Friday. [nL1N1SC01A]\n\nTrump tweeted on Friday that he would meet with U.S. trade officials once they returned from their meetings in China. “It is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins! Trump wrote.\n\nThe U.S. demands were presented to Beijing before the start of talks Thursday and Friday between top-level Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts to try and avert a damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nOn Saturday, a spokesman for Airlines for America, a trade group representing United Airlines (UAL.N), American Airlines and other major carriers, said the group was “continuing to work with U.S. government officials as we determine next steps” over China’s demands on how airlines refer to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau\n\nIn January, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), following a demand from China over listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, apologized for making “an inadvertent error with no business or political intention,” and said it had taken steps to resolve the issue.\n\nAlso in January, China suspended Marriott International Inc’s (MAR.O) Chinese website for a week to punish the world’s biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire.\n\nThe apparent intensification of efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to Chinese-claimed territories - even if only in pull-down web menus - underscores how sensitive the issue of sovereignty has become in China.\n\nChina’s aviation authority said in January it would require all foreign airlines operating routes to China to conduct comprehensive investigations of their websites, apps and customer-related information and “strictly comply with China’s laws and regulations to prevent a similar thing from happening.”\n\nAustralia’s Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) said in January it had amended its website to no longer refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong as countries, rather than Chinese territories after China issued a similar warning.","author":"David Shepardson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T16:49:42.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180505\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258819605\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE440E2","digest":"+OfN2Jl43fB9+H0FEeG4zA==\n"}

Bob Costas and Mike Tirico will host NBC’s coverage. The coverage will also be streamed on NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app.\n\nYou can also follow our story for updates throughout the day on what’s happening online, on television and on the ground at Churchill Downs.\n\nWeather: Steady rain started coming down at Churchill Downs around noon. The National Weather Service is forecasting between a tenth- and a quarter-inch of precipitation, with a high temperature near 69. The Derby has been run over a sloppy or muddy track 15 times, including last year.\n\nOdds: As of 2:26 p.m. Saturday, the favorites included Justify (3-1), My Boy Jack (5-1), Audible (6-1), Mendelssohn (6-1), Bolt d’Oro (8-1) and Good Magic (9-1).\n\nThe favorite: Justify, a son of Scat Daddy trained by Bob Baffert, opened as the favorite after winning the Santa Anita Derby by three lengths over highly rated Bolt d’Oro. Justify also was the No. 1 horse in the final Kentucky Derby Media Poll released Monday by HorseRacingNation.com, receiving seven of the 17 first-place votes.\n\nBut Justify was unraced as a 2-year old, which could be significant. According to Churchill Downs, 61 horses who were unraced as 2-year-olds have entered the Kentucky Derby since 1937, when such records were first kept. Only one horse — Apollo in 1882 — is known to have won the Derby after being unraced as a 2-year-old.\n\nA look at the Derby field and opening odds\n\nPicks and handicapping: There are plenty of alluring candidates. Baffert, a four-time Derby winner who won the Triple Crown in 2015 with American Pharoah, is back with two horses, Solomini and the favorite, Justify. Todd Pletcher will saddle Florida Derby winner Audible, Arkansas Derby winner Magnum Moon, Wood Memorial winner Vino Rosso and Louisiana Derby winner Noble Indy. Chad Brown’s colt Good Magic, who won the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, is coming off a win in the Blue Grass. Plus, there’s Mendelssohn, who destroyed the competition in Dubai by 18 1/2 lengths. The UAE Derby winner is a freak, with victories in four countries over three surfaces in seven lifetime starts.\n\nSince Andrew Beyer debuted his speed figures 26 years ago, 24 Derby winners earned a Beyer figure of at least 95 or better before the first leg of the Triple Crown. Horses that haven’t shown enough giddy-up include Hofburg (94), Combatant (94), Flameaway (93), Solomini (93), Bravazo (93), Instilled Regard (92), My Boy Jack (90), Free Drop Billy (90) and Firenze Fire (90).\n\nAudible has the speed to contend, while Bolt d’Oro has an attractive blend of speed and stamina and is the pick of The Post’s Neil Greenberg.\n\nWhich Derby post positions have produced the most winners?\n\nWant to place a bet? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nLong shots: Five straight favorites have won the race, but there was a time when long shots reigned supreme — and some of those offered big pay days. There are reasons to be optimistic about each of the 50-1 shots in the field.\n\nA case for each of the 50-1 long shots\n\nExotics: Hitting a trifecta or superfecta cold in a 20-horse field with all entrants trying a longer distance for the first time can be tough, so here’s how you could create trifecta and superfecta tickets using the contenders while also keeping ticket costs down.\n\nBest bets for the 2018 Kentucky Derby include Bolt d’Oro and other long shots\n\nExperts: With a couple favorites who would need to buck some long-standing trends (Justify, Mendelssohn) plus a number of other contenders who all seem worthy (Audible, Bolt D’Oro, Good Magic), expert picks are all over the map.\n\nRain: Bolt d’Oro remains a solid pick to win in bad weather, according to Greenberg, but he isn’t the only horse who could have success on Saturday if it does indeed rain.\n\nHorses with real-life experience over a wet track include the favorite, Justify, who won by 6 1/2 lengths in an allowance race at Santa Anita in March 11 over a muddy track. Firenze Fire won the Jerome Stakes at Aqueduct in January over a muddy track by a half-length, setting his second-best career Beyer Speed Figure (86) in that race. Flameaway won both the Skidmore Stakes at Saratoga and the Grade III Bourbon at Keeneland in the slop, and several other contenders also have history in mud.\n\nIf there is rain at the 2018 Kentucky Derby, Bolt d’Oro is still the horse to beat\n\nFor the first time in 95 years, one sire has produced four entrants at one Derby, including the top two favorites. But that horse, Scat Daddy, died unexpectedly at 11 just as his line was being established.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby field is dominated by a horse who died in 2015\n\nFor a sport alleged to have spent a lifetime languishing, horse racing has yielded a Derby chockablock with contenders and stardom. There’s a Bill Mott element, a Bob Baffert favorite, a Todd Pletcher mass and then the second favorite, the mysterious and globe-trotting Mendelssohn.\n\nThe 2018 Kentucky Derby has a slew of star power and a slew of favorites\n\nTwenty of the world’s best 3-year-old thoroughbreds will line up for a race that loves its history and usually celebrates its past. But don’t expect any remembrances of Dancer’s Image. Fifty years later, he’s the Derby’s forgotten, fallen champion.\n\nDancer’s Image, drugs and MLK: The enduring mystery of the 1968 Kentucky Derby\n\nTwo of the top three favorites, Justify and Magnum Moon, both 3 years old as the Derby forever insists, did not race while 2, a detail that clearly has caused them such ostracism among peers that they’ve had to run away from those peers. (Both are undefeated.) That, in turn, has unearthed Apollo, a horse departed for 131 years, yet whose name has turned up in Churchill Downs chitchat more than many a winner in any century. Apollo won the 1882 Kentucky Derby after not having raced at 2, something unachieved since. He did not trend on Twitter.\n\nIn the 1882 Kentucky Derby, Apollo pulled off a feat that’s still unmatched\n\n“In the world of sports,” promises the official website for the Kentucky Derby, “there is not a more moving moment than when the horses step onto the track for the Kentucky Derby post parade and the band strikes up ‘My Old Kentucky Home’ and 160,000+ people sing along.”\n\nHow do thoroughbreds get their names? The rules are surprisingly complex, and the results surprisingly amusing.\n\nJustify? Solomini? How the Kentucky Derby horses get their names.\n\nHow to make the best mint julep for the Kentucky Derby? We’ve got the recipe, plus four variations.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby means mint juleps. Here are four variations.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T13:07:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dGXnd0Ln1FRNFqhpil9iSedXdFc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R4B546UAYQ2INGSHLRODMDGYWY.jpg","digest":"t30xDzz3VIV9IrPO7gfq9g==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aee100b0a500bdef4335eac"},"description":null,"title":"After foggy departure, it's clear sailing to Mars for InSight lander","url":"https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/05/05/foggy-departure-kicks-off-insights-journey-to-mars/","text":"Making a fiery climb into a foggy sky Saturday over California’s Central Coast, a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket dispatched NASA’s InSight lander on a 301-million-mile voyage to Mars with a package of European-built instruments to probe the inside of the Red Planet.\n\nThe billion-dollar robotic mission took off at 4:05 a.m. PDT (7:05 a.m. EDT; 1105 GMT) Saturday from Space Launch Complex 3-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base, a secure military post northwest of Los Angeles that had never before hosted a launch to another planet.\n\nA veil of fog flowed across Vandenberg and surrounding communities during the countdown, blocking views of the launch from observers who gathered to see the Atlas 5 rocket send the InSight mission to Mars. A rumble from the Atlas 5’s main engine — producing 860,000 pounds of thrust — permeated the marine layer, but most nearby rocket-watchers did not glimpse the launcher’s climb into space.\n\nPowerful tracking cameras also had trouble following the Atlas 5, which disappeared into the fog a few seconds after liftoff. A long-rang infrared tracker stayed with the launcher, following the Atlas 5’s four-minute first stage engine burn.\n\nThe launcher’s Centaur upper stage took over the mission for two engine firings. The initial burn placed InSight into orbit around Earth, taking the interplanetary probe across the southern tip of South America, then north over the Indian Ocean east of Africa.\n\nA second firing of the Centaur stage’s hydrogen-fueled RL10 engine gave InSight the speed it needed to break away from the gravitational pull of Earth. After achieving escape velocity, the Centaur released the 1,530-pound (694-kilogram) InSight spacecraft at 5:38 a.m. PDT (8:38 a.m. EDT; 1238 GMT).\n\nA few moments later, two briefcase-sized CubeSats designed and built at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory deployed from a carrier on the Centaur’s aft bulkhead. The twin Mars Cube One, or MarCO, nanospacecraft will demonstrate miniaturized satellite technology in deep space, and they became the first CubeSats to leave Earth orbit with Saturday’s launch.\n\nGround controllers received the first signals from InSight through the Deep Space Network station at Goldstone, California, at 5:41 a.m. PDT (8:41 a.m. EDT; 1241 GMT), confirming the spacecraft was healthy following Saturday’s climb into space.\n\nThe MarCO CubeSats were expected to radio their status to engineers on Earth later Saturday.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who took office April 23, called to congratulate the NASA and ULA launch team from the agency’s headquarters in Washington.\n\n“This is a big day,” Bridenstine said. “We’re going back to Mars. We did it from the West Coast, which is a first-ever.\n\n“This is an extraordinary mission with a whole host of firsts,” he said. “It’s important for our country. It’s also important for the world, and it really establishes American leadership in a lot of ways.”\n\nInSight will conclude its 205-day interplanetary journey Monday, Nov. 26, with a dive into the Martian atmosphere. A thermal shield will protect the craft during descent, and a supersonic parachute and braking thrusters will slow InSight for a gentle touchdown at Elysium Planitia, an expansive equatorial plain that has not been visited by a previous spacecraft.\n\nThe MarCO CubeSats could provide a radio relay capability to beam telemetry from InSight directly to Earth as the lander drops into the Martian atmosphere. But InSight does not need the MarCO CubeSats to make a safe landing. The entry, descent and landing maneuvers will be pre-programmed into InSight’s on-board computer for the make-or-break arrival at Mars in November.\n\nOnce on the Martian surface, InSight will unfurl solar arrays and place two instruments on the ground using a robotic arm to listen for tremors and measure the heat flow coming from the planet’s super-heated interior.\n\n“In this mission, we’ll probe the interior of another terrestrial planet, giving us an idea of the size of the core, the mantle, and the crust, and our ability to then compare that to the Earth,” said Jim Green, NASA’s newly-appointed chief scientist, and former head of the space agency’s planetary science division. “This is of fundamental importance for us to understand the origin of the solar system, and how it became the way it did today.”\n\n“The goal of InSight is nothing less than to better understand the birth of the Earth, the birth of the planet we live on, and we’re going to do that by going to Mars,” said Bruce Banerdt, InSight’s principal investigator from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nBefore InSight, all of NASA’s 20 previous Mars missions departed from Cape Canaveral, taking advantage of Earth’s rotation by launching toward the east. The extra momentum gives rockets an additional boost.\n\nVandenberg Air Force Base is typically host to launches into polar orbit, a type of orbit usually tailored for climate research missions, spy satellites and some communication applications.\n\nBut InSight is small, with a mass well below the lift capability of the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket, which flew in its basic “401” configuration with a four-meter payload fairing and no solid rocket boosters.\n\nThat means the Atlas 5 did not need the extra energy imparted during an eastward launch from Cape Canaveral, and ULA and NASA agreed to launch InSight from Vandenberg. The launch contractor proposed to base the mission from the West Coast because fewer Atlas 5 missions are scheduled from Vandenberg, so officials wanted to reduce the workload at ULA’s busier launch base in Florida.\n\nDesigners based the InSight lander on NASA’s Phoenix probe, which launched in August 2007 and touched down on the northern polar plains of Mars in May 2008. Diminishing solar power and cold temperatures limited Phoenix’s lifetime to about five months — two months longer than its three-month prime mission.\n\nInSight will head for a broad plain near the Martian equator with ample sunlight year-round, providing enough warmth and solar power to keep the mission operating for nearly two years, or a little more than one Martian year, and potentially much longer.\n\nSeveral course-correction maneuvers are planned during the trip, setting up for InSight’s one-shot descent through the Martian atmosphere.\n\nEmploying a similar entry, descent and landing profile as the Phoenix mission a decade ago, InSight will approach the target landing zone in Elysium Planitia, with its heat shield absorbing blistering temperatures up to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, before unfurling a parachute and firing downward-facing rocket thrusters to settle to a gentle touchdown.\n\nMission managers selected the nearly featureless landing target because of its safety. There are few surface hazards that could spell doom for InSight, and Banerdt, the mission’s chief scientist, calls it the “biggest parking lot on Mars.”\n\nInSight was originally supposed to launch in March 2016, but problems sealing a vacuum enclosure containing one of the lander’s primary instruments, a French-developed seismometer, forced officials to postpone the mission. Mars launch opportunities come once every 26 months, when the planets are in the proper positions in the solar system, so the next chance to send InSight to the Red Planet came Saturday.\n\nEngineers redesigned the vacuum enclosure to eliminate an air leak in a feed-through, or wiring interface, used route data between the seismic sensors inside the instrument and electronics and communications equipment aboard the InSight spacecraft.\n\nThe protective enclosure keeps out wind and other environmental conditions that could disrupt the sensitive seismic measurements. It must keep a seal through the large day-and-night temperature swings on Mars.\n\n“One of these feed-throughs was not capable of maintaining itself through the large temperature extremes,” Banerdt said. “When we actually tested at Mars conditions going down to minus 100 or minus 120 degrees Celsius (minus 148 to minus 184 degrees Fahrenheit), it developed a very tiny crack and started leaking — started allowing some air to come in.\n\n“This was enough to upset the whole apple cart in terms of the sensitivity of the seismometer,” Banerdt said.\n\nJPL took over responsibility for fabricating a new enclosure, while the French space agency, CNES, remained in charge of the instrument’s internal sensors.\n\nThe two-year delayed added roughly $150 million to InSight’s cost, which now sits at more than $993 million, including launch and operations expenses. That figure includes an investment valued at approximately $180 million from the French and German space agencies.\n\nThe twin MarCO spacecraft cost another $18.5 million, according to NASA.\n\nOne of InSight’s first jobs will be to take panoramic pictures to survey the landing site, a region unexplored by past Mars missions. InSight carries cameras based on technology originally developed for the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, but with added capability for color imagery.\n\nA nearly 8-foot-long (2.4-meter) robotic arm will place the seismometer and heat probe on the Martian surface next to the lander after touchdown. InSight’s robotic arm was originally built for the canceled Mars Surveyor lander that was supposed to launch in 2001.\n\nOther leftover parts on InSight include a landing radar originally built as a spare for the Phoenix mission, and surplus structural booms from the Curiosity rover repurposed for a Spanish-built weather station on InSight to collect temperature and wind data.\n\nOnce placed on the surface of Mars, the German-made Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, know as HP3, will hammer to a depth of 16 feet, or 5 meters, a process expected to take around six weeks with roughly 10,000 individual hammer blows, accounting for several planned pauses to allow the instrument to record thermal conductivity measurements.\n\n“If you have an astronaut on the planet, you can do this in maybe 20 minutes or half an hour,” Banerdt said of the heat flow experiment. “But if you want to do it robotically, you have to get a little bit more clever.”\n\nThe metallic mole will probe deeper into the Martian crust than any past lander.\n\n“We think this remote probe can actually go down about 15 feet, which gives us a better baseline to measure the temperature increase with depth and be able to estimate the amount of heat coming out of Mars,” Banerdt said.\n\n“And that amount of heat is tied to the geological activity of the planet. It’s the heat engine of the planet that drives volcanism, it drives tectonic activity, it drives mountain-building. So all the geological processes that happen on a planet are driven by its heat engine, and we want to measure sort of the vigor of that heat engine.”\n\n“We switch on the temp sensors and record the temperature over depth and time for up to two years,” said Tilman Spohn, HP3 investigation lead from DLR, the German Aerospace Center, in Berlin. “Taking the temperature gradient, or the rate at which the temperature increases (with depth), gives us the heat flow. Very simple and straightforward, but as planetary science often is, very difficult. The devil is in the details.”\n\nThe seismometer will get to work listening for marsquakes.\n\n“Sensitive is really an understatement,” Banerdt said of the seismometer. “Tt’s an exquisitely sensitive device for measuring the motion of the ground. And when we talk about motion, we’re talking about vibrations that have an amplitude comparable to the size of an atom.\n\n“These are waves that were generated, maybe, by a marsquake on the other side of the planet, have traveled all the way through the planet, getting their waveform modified as they go through the planet and picking up information about the deep interior structure, and then we are able to pick it up when it comes back up to the surface under the seismometer,” Banerdt said.\n\nThe seismic sensors aboard InSight evolved from mission concepts in the 1990s and 2000s that would have dispatched multiple small probes to Mars, creating a global geophysical network. InSight will give scientists just one seismic station, but experts have developed techniques to glean information about the interior of Mars, even with a single seismometer.\n\nResearchers have attempted seismic detections on Mars before, but seismometers on NASA’s Viking landers in the 1970s provided inconclusive results. The instruments were mounted the decks of the landers, making them susceptible from interference from spacecraft vibrations and winds.\n\n“Not only do you have to have a very sensitive device for measuring those motions but you have to protect it from everything else that might affect it,” he said. “We have several different layers of protection, it’s sort of like a Russian doll.”\n\nAn electrical and data cable will connect the seismometer to the InSight lander.\n\nPhilippe Lognonné, head of the InSight seismic investigation team at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris in France, said scientists do not have a confirmed detection of marsquake, but evidence suggests weak tremors occur on the red planet.\n\n“We have no clear data on seismic activity on the planet,” Lognonné in an interview with Spaceflight Now. “We imagine it because we see faults on the surface. In some places, we have seen where a boulder may have fallen down from a scarp. But again, we have no data.”\n\nLognonné said, based on existing theoretical models, the seismometer could register around 20 or 30 quakes per year, sensing ripples from all types of seismic waves moving through the planet.\n\n“We cover all the seismic waves, and we even have sensitivity to tides, the Phobos tide especially,” Lognonné said. “We cover all the signals to be generated by a quake.”\n\nScientists will also measure Mars’ polar wobble by analyzing radio signals transmitted between InSight and Earth-based antennas.\n\n“By the timing of that signal, we can track the location of the spacecraft at Mars … with an accuracy of something around a foot or so, maybe a little bit less,” Banerdt said. “To me, that’s the closest we can get to magic with science.”\n\nWith that information, scientists can determine which way the Martian north pole is pointing as the planet rotates.\n\n“Over the course of a year, we can watch the north pole wobble just a little bit because of the core sloshing around inside of the planet, and that will give us a very, very tight constraint on the size of that core and its density, and so its composition,” Banerdt said. “That tells us the structure of Mars. The structure of Mars tells us something about the processes that put that structure together. We can put this into our mdoels, extrapolate it to Earth, and understand how the Earth formed four-and-half billion years ago.”\n\nMuch of the ancient geologic record on Earth has eroded away, but Mars may still hold clues about how it was born, accreted rock and dust, and formed a hot, high-pressure mantle and core as heavier elements sunk deep beneath its surface.\n\n“How we get from a ball of featureless rock into a planet that may or may not support life is a key question in planetary science,” Banerdt said. “And these processes that do this all happen in the first tens of millions of years.”\n\nDiscoveries made by InSight at Mars could inform scientists how the Earth formed and evolved.\n\n“Mars is a smaller planet,” Banerdt said. “It’s less active than the Earth, so it has retained the fingerprints of those early processes in its basic structure — the thickness of the crust, the compositon of the mantle, the size and composition of its core,” he said. “By mapping out these boundaries, these various different sections of the inside of the planet, we can then understand better how the planet formed, and how our planet got to be the way it is.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:34:52.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Spaceflightnow.com"},"urlToImage":null,"digest":"9++SJwUTNEjGluemAcRYZQ==\n"}

But staying on-message may prove a challenge for the White House.\n\n\"Remember, you have to win the great state of Ohio. And did we win the great state of Ohio,\" Trump said to open up the event, referencing his election win.\n\nMr. Trump didn't start out talking about tax reform — he spoke of what he described as unfair trade policies, and unacceptable illegal immigration. The president said it may be necessary to \"close the country\" until a border wall is built.\n\n\"Our borders are and our laws are a mess,\" the president said. Our immigration laws are a disgrace. And Mexico has very some of the toughest immigration laws in the world. You can't just go into Mexico — but they allow these people to come up through Mexico and into our country.\" The president described his frustration with how Mexico handled a \"caravan\" of migrants from Central American. Mr. Trump said Democrats \"want open borders.\"\n\n\"If you don't have borders, you don't have a country,\" he said.\n\nBut the president did touch on the tax law — the \"biggest\" in U.S. history, he said, a claim he has continued to make, despite it being proven incorrect. Mr. Trump described how he wanted to call the bill the tax \"cut, cut, cut, cut\" act, but other Republicans found it too \"hokey.\" He invited guests on stage with him to share how the tax bill has increased their paychecks. Sherry Sheely, the COO of her family's furniture retail and appliance store, said the tax bill enabled her business to give unexpected $500 bonuses to their staff.\n\n\"We had several employees who got so emotional, they cried,\" she said.\n\nYoung father  Chris Jaramillo said he and his wife were able to start a college savings account for their 1-year-old son with the $500 he received from a bonus from his company, and place him in a better daycare with the $125 more he is seeing in his paychecks because of the tax law.\n\nRep. Jim Renacci, the Republican running in an attempt to take Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown's seat in November, said at the event that the tax cuts are \"working.\"\n\nThe president said Renacci is looking good ahead of the election — \"Go out and help Jim, we'll get it done,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump's visit to Cleveland is a part of the broader GOP attempt to use December's tax reform to bolster their chances in what will be a tough midterm election cycle. But the bill's popularity isn't certain. A March 2018 Gallup poll found the bill had been gaining in popularity, but still had higher disapproval -- 48 percent -- than approval, at 39 percent.\n\nStaying on message, however, can sometimes be a challenge for the White House. On Friday, Mr. Trump was in a talkative mood en route to Dallas, where he addressed the National Rifle Association. He stopped to talk to reporters at the White House, Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and on Air Force One. As the White House looked to stay on message about pressing issues securing the nomination of Gina Haspel, nominated to run the CIA, and a positive jobs report, Mr. Trump offered his opinions on his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Stormy Daniels and the Russia investigation.\n\nGiuliani told Fox News' Sean Hannity Mr. Trump \"reimbursed\" his longtime attorney Michael Cohen for Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, ahead of the 2016 election. Mr. Trump seemed to confirm that repayment in tweets Thursday, before claiming on Friday Giuliani didn't know the full situation and will \"get his facts straight.\"\n\nMr. Trump's appearance in Cleveland also comes after the president announced Friday a date and location have been set for his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, although Mr. Trump didn't share the details.","author":"CBS News","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:11:58.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"urlToImage":"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/05/a5466231-cc1c-4204-82b8-26f99ccf8b16/thumbnail/1200x630/de8f983f58288d065530c0ad7436932e/rts1q0pa-2.jpg","digest":"HzNGwGBZS0zMRW7eOyUdrA==\n"}

About 300 Palestinians gathered near one of five protest camps set up several hundred meters from the fence after Friday prayers. Some moved closer to the fence, throwing stones and burning tires. Israeli soldiers fired live rounds and tear gas.\n\nIsraeli soldiers used loudspeakers to warn protesters to step back. \"You, stop bringing tires. The tires cause shootings.\"\n\nHamas has urged mass rallies at the border every Friday as part of a week's long campaign of protests against a decade-old blockade of the territory.\n\nIsrael is closely guarding the fence and warns it will not tolerate attempts to breach it.\n\nYehiyeh Amarin, an 18-year-old protester, was among nearly two dozen activists rolling tires toward the fence on Friday to set them ablaze. His face partially covered with a black-and-white \"keffiyeh\" scarf, he's part of a group of young protesters calling themselves \"the tires' unit,\" responsible for collecting and burning old tires along the border.\n\n\"If no solution happens by May 15 we will continue the protests or we die. We will cut through the fence.\" Amarin said, as another protester beside him brandished a yellow wire cutter.\n\nHe said they spend their weekdays collecting tires to bring to the border fence on Friday protests which they attend every week.\n\n\"We want a dignified life and a return to our lands,\" he said.\n\nThe marches are part of what organizers, led by Hamas, have billed as an escalating showdown with Israel, to culminate in a mass march on May 15.\n\nHamas says the protests are aimed at breaking a crippling border blockade that was imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group assumed control of Gaza in 2007.\n\nIsrael says it's defending its sovereign border, including nearby communities, and that soldiers only target instigators.\n\nIt accuses Hamas, a militant group sworn to Israel's destruction, of trying to carry out attacks under the guise of the mass protests. It has said that some of those protesting at the border over the past few weeks tried to damage the border fence or plant explosives along it.\n\nOthers have hurled improvised explosives, firebombs, or flown kites attached to burning rags to set Israeli fields on fire.\n\nSince weekly marches began in late March, 39 protesters have been killed and more than 1,700 wounded by army fire.\n\nRights groups say open-fire regulations are unlawful because they permit troops to use potentially lethal force against unarmed protesters.\n\nThe weekly marches also press for a \"right of return\" of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were displaced in the 1948 war over Israel's creation.\n\nPalestinians mark May 15, the anniversary of Israel's founding, as their \"nakba,\" or catastrophe.","author":"AP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T14:49:06.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"urlToImage":"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/04/459af610-e468-49cf-985b-4018d0ec225e/thumbnail/1200x630/49a8558462d5d28b3cb580d7b5d8ddcd/israel-gaza-954609446.jpg","digest":"fWA8afzIVYylW0RMpKlbSw==\n"}

This trip has been long delayed: in part a result of his frosty relationship with British Prime Minister Theresa May, but also due to the threat of widespread protests from Britons, who hold overwhelmingly negative views of the American leader.\n\nOne would think the president would attempt to mend bridges ahead of the trip, but on Friday, as he addressed the National Rifle Association convention in Dallas, Trump said that a knife crime epidemic in London had caused a hospital in the center of the city to become “like a war zone.”\n\n“I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital — right in the middle — is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,” Trump said about halfway through his 50-minute speech. “Yes, that’s right, they don’t have guns. They have knives, and instead there’s blood all over the floors of this hospital. They say it’s as bad as a military war zone hospital.”\n\nThe president used the rising number of knife attacks in Britain while speaking in support of gun rights in the United States.\n\n“London hasn’t been used to that. They’re getting used to it. Pretty tough,” Trump said. “We’re here today because we recognize a simple fact — the one thing that has always stood between the American people and the elimination of our Second Amendment rights has been conservatives in Congress willing to fight for those rights. We’re fighting.”\n\nTrump's comments immediately drew a backlash from Londoners on social media. Jim Pickard, the chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, wrote on Twitter that it was “almost like [Trump] wants London to detest him,” while BBC radio host Jeremy Vine asked: “If everyone with a knife in London swapped it for a gun, wouldn't things be much worse?”\n\nCharlie Falconer, a lawyer and representative of the left-wing Labour Party in the House of Lords, compared Britain's murder rate to the U.S. rate and added: “Trump lies on everything.”\n\nWhile Britain's murder rate is indeed far lower than the United States, there has been anxiety in the British capital recently over a wave of knife attacks that have left some young men dead. A number of British outlets reported last month that the murder rate in London had overtaken New York City's in February and March of this year — with 31 of the 47 murders in London at that point in 2018 committed with knives.\n\nHowever, the comparison is less revealing that it may seem: New York City has experienced a dramatic drop in murders over the past decade, and its murder rate is now at a historic low. A spokeswoman for London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Reuters last month that while he was concerned about violent crime, “our city remains one of the safest in the world.”\n\nIt was unclear what hospital in London the president was referring to when he spoke on Friday. In the past, some have cast doubt on the anecdotes he has used to tell disparaging stories about European capitals — for example, the identity of his friend “Jim,” a wealthy American who apparently refuses to travel to Paris because of crime fears of whom the U.S. president has spoken of several times, remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, some British journalists suspect that Trump may have been referring an interview with Mark Griffiths, the lead surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust in East London, that aired on the BBC on Thursday. The interview with Griffiths was subsequently written up by the British tabloid the Daily Mail and the U.S.-based website Breitbart.\n\nIn his interview, Griffiths had expressed concern that the age of victims of both knife and gun crime who were treated at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel appeared to be getting lower and that he was routinely treating children between ages 13 and 15. The surgeon suggested that colleagues had compared their work at the hospital to previous experience at Camp Bastion, a former British military base in Afghanistan.\n\n“Some of my military colleagues have described the practice here as similar to being at Bastion, which is a very worrying comment to hear,” Griffiths said.\n\nOn Twitter, Griffiths responded to Trump's comments by suggesting that U.S. president had missed the point and extending an invitation to visit his hospital.\n\nIn a statement, Karim Brohi, director of London's major trauma system and a trauma surgeon at the Royal London Hospital, said that his hospital had “cut the number of our young patients returning after further knife attacks from 45 percent to 1 percent.”\n\n“There is more we can all do to combat this violence, but to suggest guns are part of the solution is ridiculous,” Brohi continued. “Gunshot wounds are at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair.”\n\nThere was also anger from families affected by knife crime. One woman, whose 20-year-old daughter was shot dead in 2003, told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that she was “horrified and offended” by Trump's comments and that since he made the remarks on Friday she had received a number of phone calls from other families affected by knife and gun violence who felt the same.\n\n“Mr. Trump may be a businessman, and the U.S. does see guns as big business and money is important to them, but we are mothers and have lost our children to violence,” Bhupinder Iffat Rizvi told the Daily Telegraph.\n\nTrump has family ties to Scotland and has spoken warmly of his hopes to visit Britain. He has faced widespread criticism in the British capital for comments he made about Khan, the London mayor, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack last year and for retweeting anti-Muslim messages from a far-right activist a few months later.\n\nThough Trump does have some vocal admirers in Britain, the majority of the country views him negatively — a poll conducted earlier this year found just 1 in 10 Britons thought he was a good or great president and that 67 percent of the country said that he had been “poor” or “terrible.”\n\nIs President Trump finally heading to Britain? The saga of his long-delayed visit.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/mradamtaylor","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T15:44:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/K9PdaLcUV8mvLJHwDFFzQjhVzvA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLHVBTDGEAYNXBYFPWHOZ43MZE.jpg","digest":"aKxXwQlhpLxRsjpAvy5sNQ==\n"}

An ambulance was called to his home in Cheshire at about 9 a.m. and took him to Macclesfield district hospital. He was subsequently transferred, with a police escort, to be treated at the Salford Royal. The condition of the former Manchester United manager was not known as of late last night.\n\nFerguson, 76, retired from management in 2013 after 27 wildly successful seasons at United. He won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League crowns.\n\nHe has been somewhat visible at the club since his retirement, and was at Old Trafford just six days ago to present departing Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger with a gift.\n\nHowever, he reportedly fell ill the following week.

He celebrated his own poll numbers, repeatedly attacked Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and urged Ohioans to elect Rep. James B. Renacci (R-Ohio), who is running against Brown.\n\n“We need your vote, we need your help, so go out and help Jim,” Trump said, with Renacci seated by his side. “Get it done.”\n\nVeering off the planned topic of taxes, Trump had especially harsh words for immigrants who entered the United States illegally. He accused them of taking advantage of “catch and release” policies, accused many of not showing up for their immigration court dates and suggested they did not deserve a trial.\n\n“It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen,” Trump said. “You catch them and then you release them. This is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown.”\n\nHe went on to describe the policies as “ridiculous,” saying: “We have thousands of [immigration] judges. You think other countries have judges that give them trials?”\n\n“These are the laws we’re suffering with,” the president added.\n\nTrump reiterated his campaign promise to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, and said this nation needs secure borders “even if we have to think about closing up the country for a while.”\n\nTrump was critical of elected officials in California who have taken steps to protect undocumented immigrants there. He singled out Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D), who drew Justice Department scrutiny for tipping off the Bay Area immigrant community that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were planning raids.\n\nTrump heard testimonials from several Ohio residents during the small roundtable on how the tax law he signed in December has provided relief for their businesses and their families.\n\nSherry Sheely, who runs a furniture and appliance store in North Lima, told Trump, “Thank you for making furniture great again and thank you for making America great again.”\n\nThe event was closed to the public, but a few dozen demonstrators gathered outside the Cleveland Public Auditorium and Conference Center to protest Trump’s visit.\n\nSherrie Scarton of Berea, Ohio, was among the protesters. She said she left the GOP because of Trump’s campaign.\n\n“I am an evangelical Christian, and everything he does, all his laws and policies, are against what Jesus Christ would do,” she said.\n\nInside the conference center, Trump insisted that his presidency is “going much better than people even understand.”\n\n“The poll numbers are pretty good,” Trump added. “They actually say that I’m popular. Can you believe it? Of course, the fake news. Fake news! . . . I get nothing but bad publicity.”\n\nTrump tried to drum up support for Renacci in part by tearing down Brown. He said the Democratic senator “does not think the way we think” on immigration, health care and other issues. And he warned Ohioans not to think of Brown as an independent voice, but rather as part of “a block” of Democrats in Washington.\n\nBrown spokesman Preston Maddock said in a statement responding to Trump: “Sherrod is fighting for Ohioans every day — including working with this administration and his Republican colleagues in the Senate when it’s best for Ohio workers.”\n\nAlso during his visit Saturday to Cleveland, Trump attended a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee. The event, held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel downtown, drew about 250 donors and raised roughly $3 million for the committee, a spokesman said.\n\nReporters traveling with Trump requested access to hear the president’s remarks to donors at the fundraiser , but were denied by White House officials.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T19:33:07.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bKNfHVvC8ie2NVwZM_nCAB5VJ6A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2BXNBZCQTEI6RNZFSLEJ7Y6KJQ.jpg","digest":"6OXeQjVk14A8nOCIpM2UnA==\n"}

That’s how they were raised.”\n\nTwo hours after the gun reform rally, an “open carry” pro-gun-rights gathering drew around 30 people to Belo Garden Park.\n\nJames Singer, 27, of Pleasanton, Texas, showed up with an AR-15 rifle slung on his torso and holding a white flag emblazoned with a picture of an AR-15 and the words, “COME AND TAKE IT.”\n\nHe said they were there to show that safety increases when people have guns and to stress the importance of gun rights.\n\n“We’re here to defend the Second Amendment,” Singer said. “Without the Second Amendment, the government could do whatever it wants.”\n\nBen Jackson, an NoRA co-founder, said the group is aimed at educating the public on the NRA’s influence in government and urges voters not to support politicians who accept NRA donations, whether they be Republican or Democrat.\n\n“The amount of money the NRA spends on government really affects how we debate gun violence,” he said. “We’re not trying to take away anyone’s guns, we’re not trying to repeal the Second Amendment. We’re trying to help government function better.”\n\nDallas residents Carlo Taboada and Keila Curry said they showed up to the NoRA rally to support groups pushing gun reform. Taboada was dressed in a costume that made it look like he was being carried on the shoulders of President Trump. His T-shirt read “NRA, I’m with stupid” with an arrow pointing down.\n\n“We’re just doing our small part to ignite some change in regard to gun laws,” Taboada said. “It’s way overdue.”\n\nAt another rally at City Hall, supporters of the student-led \"Rally4Reform\" gathered at City Hall to protest what they said was the \"NRA leadership's dangerous agenda.\"\n\nIn remarks to the 80,000 participants at the convention, Trump on Friday set a tone likely to either inspire or anger activists, depending on their leaning.\n\nTrump told NRA members they need to be vigilant in the face of anti-NRA forces.\n\n\"Your Second Amendment rights are under siege,\" the president told the cheering crowd at the convention center. \"But they will never, ever be under siege as long as I am you president.\"\n\nHe also dismissed calls to ban guns as a way to reduce terrorism or gun deaths, by noting the outbreak of incidents in which terrorists used trucks to ram pedestrians. \"So lets ban all trucks and vans. Maybe all cars.\" he said.\n\nNRA spokesman Jason Brown said the group has been aware of the planned demonstrations and is taking security precautions. “NRA’s security team has worked closely with local law enforcement to ensure the safety and security of all our members, exhibitors, visitors and staff throughout the event and do not expect any issues to occur,” he said.","author":"Rick Jervis","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:58:02.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6913c7c9df184371bcfa43643b6a73adbd5fb319/c=0-248-4200-2621\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636611327995251183-EPA-USA-NRA-ANNUAL-MEETINGS.jpg","digest":"h6tk0BxmgKznS1xLY+/kKg==\n"}

Learn more about the FBI's Jim Baker.","title":"James Baker, FBI Lawyer: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know","url":"https://heavy.com/news/2018/05/james-baker-fbi-lawyer-a-jim/","text":"James Baker, a top FBI lawyer and confidante of former FBI director James Comey, resigned his position with the bureau on May 4, 2018.\n\nBaker quit on the same day as controversial FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, whose political and sometimes anti Donald Trump texts with FBI agent Peter Strzok have raised questions of bias within the Robert Mueller investigation into the president. The upheaval at the FBI has social media buzzing about Jim Baker; Baker’s name has surfaced before because he was a recipient of one of the memos that Comey wrote after meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was also previously reported by Politico that Congress was interested in contact Baker allegedly had with a reporter who first broke the story on the infamous anti-Trump dossier, although that reporter denied Baker was the leak.\n\nAccording to CNN, Baker “will be going to Lawfare, a national security blog affiliated with the Brookings Institution,” and a source said he left voluntarily and was unaware Page would be resigning the same day.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nJames Comey, who has been a lightning rod figure since his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and continuing through his book disparaging the president, tweeted out kind words for Baker. According to The Post, Comey also worked with Baker at Bridgewater Associates, an investment management company.\n\n“A great public servant retired from the FBI today,” Comey wrote on May 4, 2018 on his Twitter page. “Jim Baker’s integrity and commitment to the rule of law have benefitted our country through 5 presidents, of both parties. We are fortunate he and so many others choose to devote their lives to justice.\n\nThe previous tweet before that one was a defense by Comey of the FBI in light of comments by new Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. “I know the New York FBI. There are no ‘stormtroopers’ there; just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth. Our country would be better off if our leaders tried to be like them, rather than comparing them to Nazis,” Comey wrote.\n\nJim Baker was reassigned once Trump’s nominee Chris Wray took over the Bureau. “The FBI’s top lawyer, James Baker, is being reassigned — one of the first moves by new director Christopher A. Wray to assemble his own team of senior advisers as he tries to fend off accusations of politicization within the bureau,” The Washington Post reported in December 2017.\n\nBaker was a recipient of a Comey memo involving his conversation with Trump.\n\nThe Comey memo that Baker received by email described a purported conversation with the president about unverified allegations involving Russian prostitutes in the infamous Christopher Steele dossier, which the president has denied.\n\nNew York Magazine reported that Comey kept Baker updated about his conversations with Trump, and Baker was listed in the article as an official who might be able to corroborate Comey’s accounts. “One senior law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that Comey specifically sought legal advice from Baker about when and how to tell the DOJ about Trump pressing Comey to shut down the Russia probe,” the magazine reported.\n\nIn December 2017, The Washington Post reported that Baker had been caught up in a probe of alleged leaking in the FBI. Baker “had become caught up in what some law enforcement officials considered a particularly frustrating probe of a leak involving the FBI, the National Security Agency and stories that appeared about a year ago involving surveillance techniques for a particular email provider,” reported The Post.\n\nPolitico reported at that time that a Congressional leak investigation into Baker involved the infamous Steele dossier. “House Republicans are investigating contact between the FBI’s top lawyer and a Mother Jones reporter in the weeks before the left-leaning outlet” was first to break the story on the dossier, reported Politico, stating that “James Baker, the FBI’s general counsel, communicated with Mother Jones reporter David Corn in the weeks leading up to the November 2016 election.” However, Politico also reported that Corn denied Baker was the source for his reporting on the dossier.\n\nIt was later revealed that the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC helped fund the dossier research through a law firm. The FBI authorized payments to Steele but then fired him for contacts with the news media, The Washington Times reported.\n\nBaker also acted as counsel for Andrew McCabe, the controversial former top FBI official, Politico reported.\n\nComey, then FBI director, tapped James A. Baker to be the FBI’s general counsel in 2014, according to a press release put out by the FBI. The Post reported that he played a major role in many controversies, including “the FBI’s unsuccessful battle with Apple over the growing use of encryption in cellphones.”\n\n“Jim’s experience as a career prosecutor and as a national security official, as well his experience in the private sector, make him an excellent fit for his new position here at the FBI,” Comey said in the news release.\n\nBaker first joined the FBI in 1999. After “clerking for the Honorable Bernard A. Friedman in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Mr. Baker joined the Department of Justice (DOJ) with the Criminal Division through the Attorney General’s Honors Program in 1990 and worked as a federal prosecutor with the division’s Fraud Section,” the press release stated.\n\nDuring his years at the bureau, Baker often handled legal issues relating to national security and intelligence gathering matters. A 2007 article in The Washington Post stated that Baker and another official said they “kept Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales apprised of FBI violations of civil liberties and privacy safeguards in recent years.” Gonzales was the AG for President George W. Bush.\n\nGonzales had denied being aware of civil liberty violations, but Baker stated, “I have discussed and informed attorneys general, including this one, about mistakes the FBI has made or problems or violations or compliance incidents, however you want to refer to them,” according to The Post.\n\nIn 2006, the Post reported that some judges were upset about the use of NSA spy data and added that Baker “discovered in 2004 that the government’s failure to share information about its spying program had rendered useless a federal screening system that the judges had insisted upon…” and that led to the “temporary suspension of the NSA spying program.”\n\nIn 1996, “Mr. Baker joined the former Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR), which later became part of DOJ’s National Security Division. From 2001 to 2007, Mr. Baker served as counsel for intelligence policy and head of OIPR,” the FBI press release stated.\n\n“In this position, he developed, coordinated, and implemented national security policy with regard to intelligence and counterintelligence matters for the department. Moreover, he provided the attorney general, the U.S. intelligence community, and the White House with legal and policy advice on a range of national security issues and conducted oversight of the intelligence community, including the FBI, on behalf of the attorney general.”\n\nIn 2006, Baker “received the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in counterterrorism—the CIA’s highest counterterrorism award,” the FBI press release stated.\n\n“A year later, he received the NSA’s Intelligence Under Law Award; the NSA Director’s Distinguished Service Medal; and DOJ’s highest award— the Edmund J. Randolph Award.”\n\nHe then worked in academia and in the private sector – for Verizon – before returned to the FBI to work on cyber security matters.\n\n“That same year, he became a fellow at the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and a lecturer at Harvard Law School,” the press release said. “From 2008 to 2009, Mr. Baker was assistant general counsel for national security at Verizon Business. He then returned to DOJ, and from 2009 to 2011, served as an associate deputy attorney general working on a range of national security issues, including cyber security.”\n\nHe has given testimony to Congress on the Patriot Act and how it helps investigators.\n\nBaker “holds a juris doctorate and master’s degree from the University of Michigan and is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame,” the FBI press release stated.\n\nMichigan Law School published an article about Baker’s career, in which he was quoted as saying, “Throughout my career, I’ve been extremely lucky to have a series of fascinating jobs that have been extremely rewarding. Being General Counsel for the FBI means I have to deal with all of the legal risks and issues that confront the entire FBI—everything from counterterrorism to civil rights, and all of the FBI’s priorities across the board.”\n\nBaker explained why he kept choosing a career in government, telling Michigan Law, of his “desire to serve the country and to have a positive impact on the world” has led him to return to roles in government time and again.”","author":"Jessica McBride","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:41:46.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Heavy.com"},"urlToImage":"https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/pjimage12.jpg?quality=65\u0026strip=all\u0026w=780","digest":"OUoeOjAzqD88HRcR+WlR4w==\n"}

These included the number of court-approved selection terms, which could be a phone number of someone who is potentially the subject of an investigation, or the amount of historical information retained by phone service providers, Barrett said.\n\n“We expect this number to fluctuate from year to year,” he said.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have said the number of records collected would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers and involved a level of duplication when obtaining the same record of a call from two different companies.\n\nFriday’s report also showed a rise in the number of foreigners living outside the United States who were targeted under a warrantless internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that Congress renewed earlier this year.\n\nThat figure increased to 129,080 in 2017 from 106,469 in 2016, the report said, and is up from 89,138 targets in 2013, or a cumulative rise over five years of about 45 percent.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies consider Section 702 a vital tool to protect national security but privacy advocates say the program incidentally collects an unknown number of communications belonging to Americans.","author":"Dustin Volz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T19:59:06.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180504\u0026t=2\u0026i=1258574829\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE431LC","digest":"5GLruQF6uij5Dhx6emfnTw==\n"}

This post will be updated through the afternoon.\n\nIs it a runway or racetrack? It depends where you are at Churchill Downs. NBC’s Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski are always dressed to the nines and offered a take on what is “in” for the run for the roses, and a preview of what’s fashionable for the summer.\n\nFloral patterns are a favorite, especially busy ones. The print that used to be on your grandmother’s couch, Weir offered: If you can brighten it up, it makes for a dress or tie.\n\nYellow is also apparently in style, thanks to Beyonce’s Coachella performance in a bright yellow hoodie. Look closely, and you’ll see it everywhere at the Derby: ladies’ hats, men’s suits and even more hats.\n\nAnd about those hats: You’re going to see a lot of them this summer between the three jewels of the Triple Crown and the royal wedding. You’re looking for tall hats (like sometimes several feet in height) and sparkly hats.\n\nAnd if you’re in need of inspiration, glance through the the head-wear in this photo gallery.\n\nIt’s a very wet day at the track\n\nThe rain is the main story early in the day at Churchill Downs in Louisville It is currently raining heavily and 67 degrees, according the National Weather Service, which forecasts rain on and off through the rest of the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe track is considered “muddy” — a deeper and slower surface — and could be trending toward “sloppy” as more precipitation comes down.\n\n[Everything you need to know for the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby]\n\nMeanwhile in the grandstand, patrons are scrambling for shelter beneath some covering or trying to acquire a poncho. In the infield, NBC cameras have caught fans to covering themselves with tarps or trying to sidle up beneath an unsuspecting friends’ hat.\n\nIt is the 15th time the Derby has been run on Cinco de Mayo. Decked out sombreros are a popular choice among fans both in person and online.\n\nOn the track, the rain is starting to have an impact on the races. In the fifth race of the day, McCraken, a 4 year-old colt, came all the way from the back of the pack to win in light rain. But the precipitation hasn’t stopped, and the track has gone from fast to good to sloppy in quite a hurry.\n\nRaces Nos. 6 and 8, both on the dirt, were well behind Churchill Down’s typical pace. Horses’ hooves sink deeper into wet surfaces and don’t allow for sturdy stepping.\n\nHorses and jockeys also get chunked with the dirt flying off the track. Jockeys are known to wear up to nine pairs of goggles, pulling them down as the top pair mucks up, to see through the grime.\n\nThis post will be updated throughout the afternoon in the lead up to the run for the roses. In the meantime, here’s everything you need to know about what’s going on in the box office and on the track.\n\nHow to watch: Race coverage begins at noon on NBC Sports Network, and at 2:30 on NBC.

Adam Purinton, 52, was sentenced for premeditated first-degree murder in the Feb. 22, 2017, death of Srinivas Kuchibhotla.\n\nThe shooting stirred fears that immigrants were facing more violence after President Trump's election. It also attracted international attention, especially in India, where officials publicly wondered if their citizens were safe in the U.S.\n\nWitnesses said Purinton, who is white, uttered racial slurs at Kuchibhotla and his friend, Alok Madasani, both 32, as they enjoyed an after-work drink at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas. He was asked to leave but eventually returned and yelled \"Get out of my country!\" before firing at the men. A third man, Ian Grillot, was wounded when he tried to intervene.\n\nUnder terms of a plea agreement, District Judge Charles Droege sentenced Purinton to the maximum sentence on each of the three charges, and ordered them to run consecutively. Purinton was given two sentences of about 14 years for wounding the two men and wouldn't be eligible for parole for 77.5 years, the Kansas City Star reported.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure that he never walks in the community again, that he spends the rest of his life in the penitentiary, and I believe this sentence will achieve that result,\" Johnson County D.A. Steve Howe said Friday, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\nKuchibhotla and Madasani immigrated to the U.S. as students and were working as engineers at GPS-maker Garmin at the time of the shooting. Madasani told detectives that the gunman asked the men if their \"status was legal\" before he opened fire, according to a court affidavit.\n\nPurinton still faces federal hate crime charges for the shooting and is scheduled for a change of plea hearing May 21.\n\nNone of the victims or their family members attended Friday's sentencing.\n\nBut Kuchibhotla's widow, Sunayana Dumala, said in a statement directed to Purinton that she wished he could have seen beyond her husband's skin color to \"the beautiful and kindhearted person underneath it.\"\n\nShe said the couple was looking forward to raising a family in the dream home they had found in Kansas.\n\n\"We were supposed to be together for lifetime but now the thought of having to live life alone and the hardships that come with it is unbearable,\" she wrote.\n\nDumala said her husband was working on several large contracts at Garmin when he was killed and those contracts will provide jobs to many people. \"Imagine how much more he could have achieved and contributed to the community if not for your anger and hatred.\"\n\n\"I hope in the years that you must spend in the jail you will one day realize the magnitude of your mistake and work toward your penance,\" she said.\n\nAfter the shooting, Purinton drove 70 miles to Clinton, Missouri, where he confessed the shooting to a bartender at a restaurant.\n\nIn a written statement filed when he pleaded guilty in March, Purinton said he accepted full responsibility for the \"grievous harm\" he caused the victims, their families and the community.\n\n\"I hope that this plea might, in some small way, help reduce the suffering that I have caused them all,\" he said in his statement.\n\nPurinton, a Navy veteran, was a regular customer at Austin's. Neighbors in the Olathe neighborhood where he lived told the Associated Press that he became \"a drunken mess\" following his father's death about two years before the shooting and had physically and mentally deteriorated.","author":"CBS/AP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T18:19:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"urlToImage":"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/09/4b4c8012-a5ac-4171-9abc-4d8aadc434a4/thumbnail/1200x630/183a4dc30c89bc091e95c96fef997b06/ap-17160763141630.jpg","digest":"XozuqQYTuPxB6jCvl++vpg==\n"}

Residents there were ordered to flee amid threats of fires and “extremely high levels of dangerous” sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nThere were immediate reports of “active volcanic fountaining” — molten rock shooting as high as 80 to 100 feet in the air from ground fractures — in Leilani Estates, a subdivision in the island’s eastern Puna district filled with wooden homes tucked away on lush, tropical plant-filled lots.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, at least seven such fissure vents were reported in the neighborhood, including one that had opened anew early Saturday morning, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. More outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone, officials said.\n\nDrone footage showed lava spouting along the fissures that had formed, creeping toward Leilani Estates homes and leaving lines of smoldering trees in their wake. At least two homes in the subdivision have caught fire, Hawaii News Now reported. About 1,700 people live in Leilani Estates.\n\nAfter the eruption Thursday, the island shook at regular intervals, but especially so around midday Friday: A 5.6-magnitude quake hit south of the volcano around 11:30 a.m. local time, followed about an hour later by a 6.9-magnitude temblor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe latter was felt as far away as Oahu and struck in nearly the exact same place as a deadly 7.4-magnitude earthquake in 1975, according to the Geological Survey.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed homes visibly shaking, items clattering to the floor at supermarkets and waves forming in swimming pools as the 6.9 magnitude quake rattled the Big Island Friday afternoon.\n\n“I think the whole island felt it,” said Cori Chong, who was in her bedroom with her foster dog, Monty, when the magnitude 6.9 quake struck, frightening both of them. Even though Chong lives on the Hamakua coast, about an hour north of the earthquake’s epicenter, the shaking in her home was so violent that it caused furniture to move and glass to shatter.\n\nDavid Burlingame, who lives about two miles west of Leilani Estates, told The Washington Post he and a friend ran outside when the earthquake hit “and watched my house just shake back and forth.”\n\n“Everybody is kind of on edge,” Burlingame said Saturday, of both the potential for additional earthquakes and the unpredictability of the lava flows. “The worst part is kind of waiting to see, because you really never can tell what can happen.”\n\nThe earthquakes also prompted the rare closure of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, after they damaged some of the park’s trails, craters and roads. The first earthquake triggered a cliff to collapse into the ocean, and fissures began to appear in the ground at a popular overlook near the Jaggar Museum.\n\nPark officials said they canceled hikes Friday and evacuated about 2,600 visitors, along with all nonemergency employees.\n\n“Safety is our main priority at Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, and it is currently not safe to be here,” park superintendent Cindy Orlando said in a statement. “We will monitor the situation closely, and reopen when it is safe to do so.”\n\nThe county civil defense agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low following the earthquakes, though officials warned that residents were not in the clear yet.\n\n“Everything is still elevated,” said agency administrator Talmadge Magno, according to Hawaii News Now. “It kind of gets you nervous.”\n\nThursday’s eruption prompted the County of Hawaii’s acting mayor, Wil Okabe, to issue a state of emergency declaration. Gov. David Ige (D) also issued an emergency proclamation and activated Hawaii’s National Guard to help with evacuations.\n\nJordan Sonner, a Big Island Realtor, was on another part of the island taking pictures for an upcoming listing Thursday when she “got the call that there was lava in Leilani” and rushed back to her home, just outside Leilani Estates.\n\n“To describe it in a single word: chaos,” Sonner told The Post, of the evacuation. “My immediate threat was not the lava. It was the sulfur dioxide gas.”\n\nIt took Sonner about an hour and a half to reach her home, grab important documents and her pets — four dogs and a chinchilla — and scramble back out of there, she said. She’s now staying with a friend in Mountain View, about 20 miles northeast of Leilani Estates, and expects it could be a long while before it’s safe for residents to return.\n\n“It’s so hard to tell what is going to happen because it’s just so early. This volcano being a shield volcano, the way that it erupts, it just erupts slowly,” Sonner said. “We kind of just have to sit and wait to see what direction the lava is going to flow in and what other fissures are going to open up. This is far from over.”\n\nWhen asked if she was afraid she would lose her home, Sonner paused, before describing the uniqueness of the community there.\n\n“The way I kind of look at it is, the land doesn’t really belong to us. It belongs to Pele,” Sonner said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. “We get to live on it while we can and if she wants it back, she’ll take it. I have good insurance.”\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, at least a few hundred people had evacuated their homes in Leilani Estates and nearby Lanipuna Gardens, taking refuge at local churches, Red Cross shelters and with family and friends in other parts of Hawaii, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nGabbard warned that, in some ways, the threat from the sulfur dioxide gas could be more dangerous than the lava flows, which had stopped in places after the eruption. If conditions worsened, even first responders would not be able to go into the affected neighborhoods to help trapped residents, she added.\n\n“Sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal, especially to those who have respiratory illnesses,” Gabbard said. “The wind can push [the gas] in different directions, so that’s a very serious concern given the high levels and, you know, people don’t necessarily have the kinds of protective gas masks that they would need if they were right in the thick of this gas.”\n\nKilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on Hawaii Island, according to USGS. The eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island Thursday morning. As The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reported, Kilauea is made of basalt, a fluid lava that makes for effusive — rather than explosive — eruptions:\n\nRather than building up into a steep, towering peak like Krakatau in Indonesia or Mount St. Helens in Washington state, the fluid rock at Kilauea creates a broad, shallow dome known as a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes “are really voluminous, the largest volcanoes on Earth, but because they have those long, low-angle slopes, they’re not very dramatic,” said Tari Mattox, a geologist who worked at the Hawaii Volcano Observatory for six years. “People are surprised when they go to Hawaii and they say, ‘Where’s the volcano?’ And I tell them, ‘You’re standing on it!’ ” … Rocks moving upward through the mantle beneath Hawaii begin to melt about 50 miles beneath the surface. That magma is less dense than the surrounding rock, so it continues to rise until it “ponds” in a reservoir that’s roughly three miles wide and one to four miles beneath the summit. As pressure builds in the magma chamber, the magma seeks out weak spots in the surrounding rock, squeezing through the earth until it reaches a vent to the surface.\n\nGeologists said the current seismic activities around Puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption, according to Hawaii News Now. That eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava, the news site reported.\n\nMore recently in 2014, lava again threatened the Puna district, specifically the town of Pahoa and its surrounding area, The Washington Post reported. During that event, lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour, and up to 60 structures were at risk.\n\nHawaii might be about to ban your favorite sunscreen to protect its coral reefs\n\nHawaii missile alert: How one employee ‘pushed the wrong button’ and caused a wave of panic","author":"https://www.facebook.com/lindseybever","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T15:50:35.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y4okUDwK_wipgPZyDwu4B4FEHY4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OIXEBVSYAY3XNNOSPXYJEG7UA4.jpg","digest":"GzDAiWYsouRC2iVjT3kCfw==\n"}

AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais\n\nPresident Donald Trump has emerged from a year on the brink of nuclear war with North Korea with a prospective, unprecedented meeting with its leader Kim Jong Un on the books, renewed hopes of peace, and Nobel Peace Prize buzz.\n\nPut bluntly, the reversal in North Korea's attitude towards the US represents one of the most stunning turns in politics since Trump scored a tremendous upset to win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSo far, North Korea has repeatedly promised it will denuclearize, and has invited the US and South Korea to observe part of that promise. North Korea hasn't asked for the US to do anything in exchange besides agree not to invade them.\n\nWhen a Trump administration official called for US detainees in North Korea to be released as a sign of Pyongyang's sincerity, days later reports emerged that Kim had allowed just that.\n\nAll of these developments are so far only talk and plans. But they represent big wins for Trump's stated aims: peace and denuclearization.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has credited Trump with creating the atmosphere necessary for an inter-Korean summit. North Korea expert John Delury wrote at 38 North that this has \"put diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula off to a very good start.\"\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un toasts with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, as he paid an unofficial visit to China, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 28,2018. KCNA/via Reuters\n\nA snap meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Kim just weeks after Trump accepted an offer to meet with Kim indicates that China may be struggling to insert itself into a dialogue that seems to put US concerns first.\n\nChina wants the US military out of South Korea. The presence of nearly 30,000 US troops near its borders troubles China, which feels the US is trying to contain it.\n\nThe US's missile defenses in South Korea also have radars that can see deep into Chinese territory, and which China fears could hobble it in a nuclear war with the US, thereby making it an existential threat.\n\nBut neither North Korea nor South Korea has pushed for the US to leave the Korean Peninsula. In fact, if North Korea seriously goes through with verifiable denuclearization, a US or UN military presence could creep even closer to China above the 38th parallel.\n\nJapan is also scrambling to set up a meeting with Kim, thought thus far it has been denied. Instead, Japan will meet with South Korea and China to lobby them to insert their interests into the negotiations as the Koreas speed on without them.\n\nTrump's North Korea policy is going pretty well, so far. But North Korea has made many of the exact promises it has made in previous negotiations, only to back out again and double down on its nuclear ambitions.\n\nAll of the progress made so far on peace in the Koreas has been talk, occurring at a rapid pace. There's laughter, hand-holding, and promises by the plenty, but not a single screw loosened on a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nTrump sailed through the niceties, but has not yet hit the concrete work of denuclearizing, which experts nearly unanimously think will be very difficult.\n\nIn fact, Jeffrey Lewis, the go-to expert on North Korea for CNN, The New York Times, and often Business Insider, recently wrote an article in Foreign Policy called \"Optimism About Korea Will Kill Us All.\"\n\nIn the piece he argues that expectations have been set too high for the Trump-Kim summit, and could eventually lead to disappointment, and then a war in which we all die.\n\nBut both Moon and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continue to affirm Kim's commitment to denuclearization, likely knowing fully the risks that shattered expectations would bring.\n\nA view of the newly developed intercontinental ballistic rocket Hwasong-15's test that was successfully launched, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang November 30, 2017. Reuters\n\nNorth Korea recently announced that it's done with its nuclear weapons program. After successfully testing an intercontinental-range ballistic missile and what experts describe as a thermonuclear bomb, it has called for an end to testing.\n\nNuclear and ICBM tests prompted many of the recent, heavy sanctions placed on North Korea. The tests served as a major irritant in the US, South Korea, Japan, and even China's relationship with Pyongyang.\n\nNow that North Korea has credibly built nuclear missiles that it and much of the world can confidently say will work enough of the time to matter, it doesn't have to do tests any more.\n\nHaving ditched its most annoying habit — nuclear detonations and missile launches — North Korea can now pursue a different relationship with its neighbors and former foes, who will no longer have to respond to shocking media stories about the scary, defiant launches.\n\nEven if North Korea only stops testing and maintains some residual, secretive nuclear capability while talking to and pursuing peace with the outside world, that's a big win for Trump's presidency, as he would have secured a unique and positive result from his unorthodox approach to the conflict.\n\nNorth Korea's peace push and promises have by no means eliminated the possibility of nuclear war on the peninsula, but then again, nothing can ever guarantee that war in Korea definitely won't happen.\n\nBut under Trump's watch, Pyongyang has moved to delay war, and in a world where war is always possible, delays might be as good as it gets.","author":"Alex Lockie","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T13:08:34.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5aec858f19ee864d468b470e-640-320.jpg","digest":"Vb55nQkDpFPS9hPslVeE2A==\n"}

And if nothing else, it should make us aware that we need to be careful when these commercial ships are docking, when your country needs to see what’s on them. And certainly, the family of Elaine Chao and McConnell should be no exception to that.”\n\n — Blankenship, in an interview on Fox News, May 2, 2018\n\n\n\nThis fact check explores whether “Cocaine Mitch” is an accurate nickname for the Senate majority leader.\n\nHow did we end up here?\n\nBlankenship, a Republican candidate in the Senate primary in West Virginia, released an ad claiming that “politicians … blew up the coal mine and then put me in prison.”\n\nIn fact, Blankenship spent a year in prison because a jury convicted him of conspiracy to violate federal safety standards. A 2010 explosion at a coal mine owned by Massey Energy, where Blankenship was chief executive, killed 29 workers at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. A state investigation found that Massey Energy’s negligence was the main reason for “the faulty ventilation system, the inadequate application of rock dust and the equipment failures” that caused the blast.\n\nAnyway, out of the blue, at the end of this ad, Blankenship calls McConnell “Cocaine Mitch.” He doesn’t explain it. There’s no tie-in to any of the other things Blankenship says in the ad. He just throws it out like a slab of red meat.\n\nBlankenship’s campaign later issued a news release (“Don Blankenship Releases ‘Cocaine Mitch’ Ad Explanation”), which we read with interest.\n\nBlankenship is competing in the May 8 primary for the Republican Senate nomination in West Virginia, where Sen. Joe Manchin III (D) is running for reelection in November.\n\nThe specific attack line about “Cocaine Mitch” has nothing to do with drug use. As our colleague Amber Phillips of The Fix pointed out, some Republican primary candidates choose to run as foils to the GOP establishment. In West Virginia, Blankenship has been firing off attacks at McConnell, his wife and his in-laws lately.\n\nMcConnell is married to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whose family owns a New York shipping company named Foremost Group. The company was founded as Foremost Maritime Corp. by McConnell’s father-in-law, James S.C. Chao.\n\nAs of 2015, McConnell’s net worth was somewhere between $11 million and $43 million, according to Open Secrets. Lawmakers are required to disclose their assets and liabilities in broad ranges, not specific figures, which makes it tough to nail down exactly how wealthy they are.\n\nAs The Fact Checker previously reported, McConnell’s net worth appeared to surge in 2008, when he and his wife disclosed a tax-exempt money-market fund valued at between $5 million and $25 million. Elaine Chao inherited this money after her mother died in 2007, a McConnell spokesman told The Fact Checker.\n\nIn its news release, the Blankenship campaign pointed to an article in the Nation magazine from October 2014. Relying on an interview with a coast guard official in Colombia, the Nation reported that authorities in that country had found 40 packages of cocaine, or about 90 pounds, aboard the Ping May, a bulk carrier owned by Foremost Group. The ship was docked at the Colombian port city of Santa Marta and destined for the Netherlands with a shipment of coal, the magazine reported.\n\nThe Fact Checker found an August 2014 news release from the Colombian navy that corroborated much of the Nation’s reporting. According to the navy, the Ping May had arrived from the United Kingdom in mid-August 2014 and was departing for Rotterdam with its coal shipment later that month when Colombian authorities discovered the 40 packages of cocaine. “No persons were captured in the operation,” the Colombian navy said.\n\nTwo months later, when the Nation’s article was published, the Colombian investigation was described as ongoing, and no charges had been filed. The Nation did not follow up with more articles, and we couldn’t find any more information about this case in Colombian media.\n\n“Mitch McConnell and his family have extensive ties to China,” the Blankenship campaign’s news release says. “His father-in-law who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years. The company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe. Hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we’ve deemed him ‘Cocaine Mitch.’”\n\nOkay! Wow! There’s a lot to unpack here!\n\nFirst, Foremost Group is not a “Chinese shipping company.” It’s an American company, based in New York.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence that McConnell’s father-in-law has “given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.” Elaine Chao received an inheritance valued at between $5 million and $25 million after her mother’s death in 2007. This was years before the drug bust in Santa Marta in 2014. There is no record of McConnell receiving any other financial windfall from his in-laws.\n\nBlankenship’s news release cites a book about McConnell and other politicians called “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” by Peter Schweizer. In an interview with Breitbart News, Schweizer refers to this same $5 million to $25 million, and nothing else, as an example of the money McConnell has received from his father-in-law. “McConnell himself has benefited because a few years ago, James Chao gave Mitch McConnell a gift between five and twenty-five million dollars that more than quadrupled his net worth overnight,” Schweizer told Breitbart. Notice how he describes Elaine Chao’s inheritance as a “gift” from her father to McConnell.\n\nThird, neither the Nation nor the Colombian navy reported that the cocaine was worth $7 million. The only way Blankenship’s campaign could have landed on that number is by making extra-generous assumptions.\n\nIn the United States, “the street price varies enormously because it depends on purity, which itself varies enormously,” Tom Wainwright, a journalist who wrote “Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel,” said in an email. “So people tend to quote figures for a pure gram (or kilo). The street price of a pure gram is roughly $150 (i.e., the equivalent of $150,000 per kilo), though again it will vary a lot.”\n\nHe added: “In practice, what you buy will probably be cheaper than that because it won’t be anything like 100 percent pure. You might pay $75 for a gram of ‘cocaine’ that is in fact 0.5g cocaine and 0.5g other random stuff.”\n\nAssuming a street price of $150,000 per kilogram for the 40 packages of cocaine on the Ping May gets you to only $6 million, though, so it’s unclear how the Blankenship campaign arrived at $7 million. Perhaps it assumed that diluting the cocaine with cornstarch, caffeine or other additives would yield another $1 million. In any case, prices are lower in Europe, where these drugs were actually headed.\n\nMost important, as of this writing, Colombian authorities do not appear to have filed charges in the Ping May drug bust. Charges would indicate that the Colombian government identified suspects, and who they were.\n\nThe Fact Checker reached out to the Colombian Embassy in Washington. We asked what the outcome of the Ping May investigation was and whether any charges were filed. A spokeswoman for the embassy referred us to a captain in the Colombian navy, who did not respond to our questions.\n\nThe absence of known charges is key.\n\nThe Ping May is a huge vessel with 91,385 tons of cargo capacity, which is about the same as 20 million cats, assuming each cat weighs the average 10 pounds.\n\nFor comparison, the 40 packages of cocaine, about 90 pounds total, would weigh the same as nine cats.\n\nJoaquin Perez, a criminal defense lawyer in Miami who specializes in international drug-trafficking cases, said it would be difficult for Colombian authorities to charge anyone in these circumstances.\n\nHe said, “Forty kilos in a big ship with containers and stuff like that is not a significant amount, and in order to be able to ascribe responsibility to a person in such a large ship,” authorities would need to establish a clear nexus. Had the 40 kilos been found inside a shipping container, perhaps the company that owned the cargo inside might be held responsible. (The Ping May is a bulk carrier, though, so there were no containers.)\n\nThe Colombian navy said the drugs were found in the ship’s chain locker, a forward part of the ship that contains the anchor chain when the anchor is up.\n\n“If it was found in the captain’s room, then you can charge the captain, or in one of the crew members’ rooms,” Perez said. “But short of that, I don’t know how you can charge anything.”\n\nIn short, just because Colombian officials found cocaine on the Ping May doesn’t mean Foremost Group was shipping it or planning to profit from its sale. Who hid the drugs in the ship’s chain locker? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s important to remember that Colombian authorities do not appear to have charged the ship’s captain or crew. They didn’t charge Foremost Group or the Chaos. They certainly didn’t charge McConnell.\n\nSpokespeople for McConnell and Foremost Group would not comment, and the Blankenship campaign did not respond to our questions.\n\nThis is a Four Pinocchio claim!\n\nSet aside the four or five degrees of separation between McConnell and his wife’s family’s shipping company and the fact that Elaine Chao collected the inheritance at issue years before 2014. Without charges or further information from Colombia, we can’t determine who was trying to smuggle drugs on the Ping May.\n\nWe understand that “Cornstarch Mitch” is not as catchy as “Cocaine Mitch.” But the bottom line is that Blankenship has no evidence to support his crude and incendiary attack.\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nKeep tabs on Trump’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T07:06:16.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IHN9Xc7oWPj1wVXefH6WkZHGiWA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2QLLBOBS466FJP7M73XYDNAK4.JPG","digest":"hZ/YPj3oBxJT+vjtxx0/tA==\n"}

He then pantomimed spitting on a piece of paper meant to represent the 2015 nuclear accord, drawing raucous cheers.\n\nGiuliani was hired in April to be Trump’s lawyer in the matter of the special counsel probe into the 2016 election and possible collusion with Russia by members of Trump’s campaign.\n\nTalking to reporters after the speech, Giuliani said he based his comments on the known positions on Iran of Trump, Bolton and Pompeo, not on any special information gleaned from within the White House about the administration’s plans.\n\nTrump has hinted he may exit the accord by a May 12 deadline, calling it “a horrible agreement for the United States.” Iran is ruling out new talks, calling the current agreement “non-negotiable.” America’s European allies continue to back it, saying the deal has been essential to reining in Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nStill, that deadline may not mean an immediate termination to negotiations over the agreement. While Pompeo, sworn in as the top U.S. diplomat in late April, hasn’t promised a grace period, he said at his Senate confirmation hearing in April that “even after May 12 there is still much diplomatic work to be done.”\n\nSpeaking in the Middle East on April 29, Pompeo called Iran “the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world,” and reiterated his boss’s message: that the U.S. will pull out of the nuclear accord if the “flawed” deal can’t be fixed to its satisfaction.\n\nBolton, who was named national security adviser in March, has called the Iran agreement a “strategic debacle.” He said on Fox News in January that the deal should be scrapped, economic sanctions reimposed, and regime change encouraged.\n\nFor weeks, U.S. negotiators have been meeting with allies France, the U.K. and Germany in an effort to reach a consensus on side agreements responding to U.S. concerns. They say they’ve made progress on some elements but haven’t crossed the finish line on the “sunset clauses” in the current deal -- under which many of the key provisions expire in coming years and Iran is allowed to start enriching uranium to high levels again.\n\nUnder the agreement made in 2015, Iran would redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities while accepting inspections in return for an end to all nuclear-related economic sanctions, boosting oil revenue and regaining frozen assets.\n\nThe deal was heavily criticized by Republicans at the time it was finalized as being soft on Iran, while Democrats applauded the relief it provided from a potential nuclear-armed nation hostile to the U.S.","author":"Alan Bjerga","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T21:16:42.000Z"},"source":{"id":"bloomberg","name":"Bloomberg"},"urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iY0EwnqMkVb0/v1/1200x721.jpg","digest":"k6w78AgEWB6ElxzoWR07ig==\n"}

John Richardson said.","title":"The Navy is resurrecting a fleet to protect the East Coast and North Atlantic from Russia","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/05/05/the-navy-is-resurrecting-a-fleet-to-protect-the-east-coast-and-north-atlantic-from-russia/","text":"The U.S. Navy has reactivated a fleet responsible for overseeing the East Coast and North Atlantic — an escalation of the Pentagon’s focus on a resurgent Russia and its expanding military presence.\n\nThe 2nd Fleet, deactivated in 2011 to preserve funds for new ships, will resume operations in Norfolk on July 1, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson told reporters Friday.\n\n“This is a dynamic response to the dynamic security environment,” Richardson said onboard the carrier George H.W. Bush. “So as we’ve seen this great-power competition emerge, the Atlantic Ocean is as dynamic a theater as any and particular the North Atlantic, so as we consider high-end naval warfare, fighting in the Atlantic, that will be the 2nd Fleet’s responsibility.”\n\nNavy officials had previously recommended reactivating the fleet as part of broader reviews following last year’s row of deadly collisions among ships in the Japan-based 7th Fleet.\n\nIn a separate statement, Richardson invoked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s national-defense strategy as key guidance to reestablish the fleet, which will extend halfway across the Atlantic until it meets the area of responsibility for the Italy-based 6th Fleet.\n\n[Top general tells Marines in Norway to be prepared for a big fight]\n\nMattis’s framework, released in January, said “long-term strategic competitions” with Russia and China are the top Defense Department priorities as the Pentagon seeks to pivot away from counterinsurgencies that have consumed funding and exhausted resources since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nDefense officials and analysts have said those operations took attention away from modernizing the military, allowing Russia and China to close the technological gap with newer and deadlier weaponry.\n\nIn that time, Russia has occupied Crimea and Ukraine and provoked a host of hostilities against the West, including cyberattacks and interference in elections in Europe and the United States. That also includes an uptick of Russian submarines prowling for undersea telecommunications cables used by NATO.\n\nThe reactivation of the 2nd Fleet signals the Navy’s desire to “operate more powerfully and credibly in the North Atlantic,” Bryan McGrath, a former destroyer commander and deputy director of the Center of American Seapower at the Hudson Institute, said Saturday.\n\n[U.S. accuses China of directing blinding lasers at American military aircraft in Djibouti]\n\nOne concern the 2nd Fleet will immediately address: the threat from a now-modest number of Russian nuclear attack submarines capable of cruising in the depths off the East Coast, McGrath told The Washington Post.\n\nSubmarines like the nuclear-powered K-329 Severodvinsk are equipped with hypersonic anti-ship missiles and nuclear-capable missiles that can reach any city on the Eastern Seaboard within range, he said.\n\nRussian submarines can also create a hazard of mines and anti-submarine missiles that would complicate a deployment in support of NATO allies, risking an escalation of tension with U.S. cities in range, he said.\n\nPatrols will likely start soon after and involve manned and unmanned surface ships, attack submarines and air surveillance by P-8 Poseidon aircraft, a sub-hunting warplane.\n\nMcGrath also said having a likely three-star vice admiral at the fleet will improve coordination with NATO allies, particularly with Northern Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 2nd Fleet’s reactivation will free up the Navy’s Fleet Forces for its original mission to train and provide forces to commanders worldwide. It had previously assumed responsibility for the fleet’s mission after the 2011 disestablishment.\n\nThe move also arrives alongside broader NATO strategies to counter Russia. In a separate announcement Friday, the Pentagon said it proposed a NATO Joint Force Command for the Atlantic in Norfolk.\n\n“To quote Ned Stark: ‘Winter is coming,’” McGrath said, referring to a “Game of Thrones” character who warns of approaching conflict. “There is a general sense a revisionist power in Russia is dedicated to opposing the U.S. in many arenas, and military opposition is increasingly one of them.”\n\nDeadly Navy accidents in the Pacific raise questions over a force stretched too thin\n\nSpike in ‘minor’ aviation mishaps a ‘leading indicator’ to examine, Navy secretary says\n\n‘A C-130 literally just dropped out of the sky’: A deadly plane crash stuns drivers in Savannah","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T20:50:51.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VPkOc5O5u4uAq0kdgomUWe95xHM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AIZVLVCK5Q4L7OQOIAFWKWRULE.jpg","digest":"ChTUA0NE/V6Wuef8Qy9Ljw==\n"}

Trump ran against political correctness in the United States,” the statement said. “He will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.”\n\nMr. Trump used somewhat milder language during his three-hour visit to Cleveland. Gathering a round-table of steelworkers and small-business people, ostensibly to promote the effects of the Republican tax cut, he ended up celebrating seemingly every other aspect of his presidency, including his poll numbers, which he claimed were on the rise.\n\n“They actually say that I’m popular — Can you believe that?” he said, though he went on to complain, “I get nothing but bad publicity.”\n\nIf there was a recurring theme, however, it was Mr. Trump’s insistence that he would restore the balance with major trading partners like China. He listened as an Ohio couple, the Thorntons, recounted the hardship they suffered after the steel mill near Youngstown that employed Kevin Thornton shut down — because, his wife, Sharlene, said, of competition from China.\n\n“We almost lost our home,” she said. “We struggled every day to make ends meet.” She thanked Mr. Trump, and his tax cut, for making their lives “more enjoyable.”\n\nThe president took credit for the opening of new steel plants and steel mills in the United States. While he repeated his praise for China’s president, Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump said the United States would no longer tolerate running huge deficits with Beijing.\n\n“We’re going to be smart about our relationships with other countries,” he said. “You look at our trade deficits with every other country. Don’t let anyone ever tell you that trade deficits are O.K.”\n\nDespite his occasional wanderings into other subjects, Mr. Trump largely stuck to his script after a wild week in which he spoke off the cuff about issues like his legal troubles and his efforts to win the release of three Americans being held in North Korea.\n\nMr. Trump had suggested their release would be imminent. But on Saturday, White House officials had no updates on the status of the three: Kim Hak-song, also known as Jin Xue Song; Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk; and Kim Dong-chul.\n\nMr. Trump’s trip was intended to bolster the Senate campaign of his preferred candidate, Representative James B. Renacci, who is challenging the populist Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, and has allied himself closely with the president. Democrats and Mr. Trump himself are treating the midterm elections as a referendum on his presidency.\n\nThe president also attended a fund-raiser with 250 high-dollar donors, netting $3 million, according to the Republican National Committee. The news media was barred from attending.\n\nMr. Trump steered clear of reporters, shedding no light on the miasma of questions about his knowledge of payments to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, after a series of conflicting statements by Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the newest members of the president’s legal team.\n\nThe White House statement on China came in response to a letter that the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration sent last month to 36 foreign carriers, instructing them to stop listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as independent entities.\n\nBeijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province of China, while Hong Kong and Macau are former British and Portuguese colonies that returned to Chinese sovereignty almost two decades ago.\n\nThe White House accused China of coercing American companies and citizens, and said it was an extension of the repression it practices on the internet domestically. American companies, it said, should have the freedom to decide how to communicate with their customers.\n\nThe sharp response comes at a time of deepening tension between the United States and China over trade and security. The trade meeting in Beijing produced no agreement, even on whether the two sides should meet again.\n\nThe White House also warned China of “consequences” after reports that the Chinese government had deployed antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles to three artificial islands in the South China Sea.","author":"Mark Landler","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T20:09:25.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/us/06dc-trump/06dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"UxpKhHyJSDQsKVWo8f4sXQ==\n"}

The amount rose to $245,000 as Trump’s income grew during the presidential race in February 2016.\n\nCohen also gained possible access to an additional $529,000 through a mortgage he co-signed with his wife for a condominium owned by her parents at Trump World Tower in late 2015, the Journal reported.\n\nThat was in addition to refinancing existing debt on the condo, which his wife's parents bought in 2004. The Journal reported that it’s unclear whether or how that money was spent.\n\nThe Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether Cohen committed bank fraud by making false statements regarding his assets as part of an effort to secure loans. Authorities are also reportedly looking into whether Cohen ever misstated the intended purposes of the loans.\n\nThe newspaper said neither Cohen, his lead attorney nor his wife's parents responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe transactions could be investigated by federal prosecutors who are examining Cohen’s business practices, sources told the Journal.\n\nInvestigators have been looking at Cohen's ownership of real estate and New York taxi medallions.\n\nThe FBI raided his home, office and hotel room last month, reportedly seeking documents related to a $130,000 payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels shortly before the election.\n\nCohen previously said he had used his home-equity line of credit to pay Daniels just weeks before the presidential election in exchange for her to stay quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump more than a decade ago.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said that Cohen was reimbursed for that payment through a $35,000 monthly retainer from Trump.

With voters preparing to start mail balloting Monday for the June 5 primary, Republicans are casting solidly-Democratic California -- the world’s sixth largest economy and home to Silicon Valley -- as a broken state hobbled with rising crime and taxes that are sending businesses and residents fleeing.\n\nAnd they’re attacking the two Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, as part of the problem.\n\n“People look around and they ask why we have the highest level of poverty in the United States?’’ said Assemblyman Travis Allen, a conservative populist from Huntington Beach who has focused his run for governor on the issue of illegal immigration. “Why do we have this exploding homeless population? And what have the California Democrats done to fix it?’’\n\nWealthy GOP businessman John Cox of Rancho Santa Fe -- who’s now in second place behind Democrat Gavin Newsom in the governor’s race in California, where the primary doesn’t take party into account -- helped finance an effort to put before voters a ballot measure to repeal the state’s new gas tax, which is overwhelmingly unpopular with Republicans.\n\n“I think the people of this state want better management and they want a businessperson. They’ve got one in the White House,’’ he said in an interview. “The politicians have just run this state into the ground.”\n\nCox ticks off a list of issues that he says will drive GOP voters to turn out at the polls: “This state is the most unaffordable state in the country, the highest taxes, the most people in poverty. It’s got the worst education system. We were just voted the worst business climate in the country. Regulations are a joke. Small business formation is at an all time low. Businesses are moving out left and right.”\n\n“I don’t know at all how any politician can claim they have managed this state well -- and I think the people know it,’’ he said.\n\nMany Republicans, like Jim Brulte, the state party chair, resist the notion of Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi, who counter that the president’s unpopularity and current troubles – including the Stormy Daniels drama and Robert Mueller’s probe – will have a corrosive effect on GOP turnout in California that will help Democrats win back the House as well.\n\n“You want to know why every word out of the Democrats’ mouth is Donald Trump?” Brulte said. “Because they don’t want the voters of this state focusing on what’s happening here. They owned the state, they broke the state – and Republicans, we’re the fix.”\n\nMany Republicans this weekend at their San Diego convention, where “Make America Great Again” hats and “Repeal the Gas Tax” signs were snapped up, reserved their most intense ire for the SB54, the “California Values Act’’ -- also known as the “sanctuary state” bill, which supporters say is aimed at protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants. Costa Mesa this week became the latest municipality in California to opt out of the bill, joining Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Simi Valley and Orange County among a crowd in what’s been called growing “revolution” against the measure.\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, a member of the Republican National Committee and a civil rights attorney, told a packed crowd of Republicans Saturday that with the bill, California Democrats are attempting to unconstitutionally override federal jurisdiction and “force law enforcement into a more dangerous position that makes all of us a little less safe.”\n\n“Californians are fed up,’’ said Dhillon, a former vice-chair of the state GOP. “We’re beginning to see a backlash with sanctuary city issues,’’ said Dhillon. “There’s a secret Trump support out there. Democrats feel very smug when they look at the polls, but people say one thing to the pollsters and another to other voters.”\n\nBut California State Senator Kevin de Leon, the author of SB54 -- and a regular target of GOP candidates -- told POLITICO the Republican playbook aims to mislead voters and pump up anti-immigrant sentiment this weekend is merely a desperate attempt to energize a weakening voter base.\n\n“Like Trump, these fake patriots lie about what the bill does,’’ he said. “The fact is, SB 54 expressly exempts dangerous and violent criminals and promotes public safety by having local law enforcement focused on keeping communities safe, not enforcing federal immigration laws. By wide margins Californians see through Trump’s lies and reject his race based immigration policies.”\n\nDe Leon said, “Pro-Trump Republicans are out of step with California values. Try as hard as they might they cannot turn back the clock to 1994,’’ adding: “We simply refuse to go back.”\n\nBut Lanhee Chen, a former advisor to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, says Republicans hoping for some wins this year in an overwhelmingly Democratic state may get traction -- by using the bill to point to “a number of examples of gross mismanagement and public policy in California,’’ some of them related to immigration.\n\nAlong with fears generated by some high profile crimes like the Kate Steinle murder, there has also been a sense “that urban blight in California has gotten really bad,’’ with homeless encampments mushrooming in Democratic cities like San Francisco and Oakland. “Those law-and-order issues resonate with voters in the Republican party -- and independent voters as well,’’ Chen said.\n\nThat’s why party activists may be banking hopes on their chances of beating one of the Democratic “flawed candidates”-- such as Newsom or Villaraigosa, who have both been the focus of independent expenditures efforts hammering away way at past sexual transgressions of both men. Chan says some Republicans believe that may create “an opportunity for a Republican to sneak in here.”\n\nBut Steve Frank, a longtime party activist and publisher of California News \u0026 Views -- a conservative website -- cautions that if Republicans really want to take back the governor’s seat in California, they need to follow the example of the man in the White House, who got there despite the predictions of pundits.\n\n“Trump had a message -- and he had solutions,’’ said Frank, who hasn’t endorsed either Cox or Allen. Neither of the Republican candidates has gained traction, he said. “They have headlines, but no solutions.”","author":"CARLA MARINUCCI","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T21:56:50.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/84/32/ddc827f44d0499fd52aac9d006bd/180505caliap-18123707875423.jpg","digest":"rnS/1I55m1W58Cd9ezJVdw==\n"}

The company sponsored the horse, which walked around in an ebook-themed blanket. If he won the 144th run for the roses, and he entered the race on 6-1 odds, the company would give away free audio versions of “American Pharoah,” by Joe Drape.\n\nWell, Audible didn’t win. He came in third, behind Justify and Good Magic. Audible, the company doesn’t care. America still gets a free audio book.\n\nJustify, the winner, is a different kind of gift to the horse racing world. He is the first Derby winner since Apollo in 1882 to win the race without having run at all as 2 year-old.\n\nAnd did he ever do it in dominant fashion. When Good Magic challenged him at the top of the stretch, Justify pulled away with ease.\n\nLearn the controversy behind “My Old Kentucky Home”\n\nOn a rainy Saturday, as race favorites Justify, My Boy Jack, Audible and the rest of the horses head to the gates, the University of Louisville choir will once again led Churchill Downs in the ritual singing of “My Old Kentucky Home.” Many people belting out the lyrics have no idea that the history behind the song is so fraught.\n\n“My Old Kentucky Home” is the state song of Kentucky. It was written before the Civil War by storied American songwriter Stephen Foster, who is considered the “father of American music.” The song has made appearances in “Gone With The Wind” and “The Simpsons” and been recorded by everyone from Al Jolson and Bing Crosby to Marian Anderson and Louis Armstrong.\n\nBut last month the city of Pittsburgh, Foster’s home town, removed a controversial statue of him with a black man sitting at his feet, singing and strumming the banjo.\n\nThe 800-pound statue, created in 1900 by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti, had been a controversial monument at Schenley Plaza, with critics saying it “glorifies white appropriation of black culture, and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Defenders argued that it simply showed Foster listening to a song by a black musician.\n\nRead more here from Retropolis.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby always draws a whole bunch of celebrities and A-list athletes. This year is no different. Check out this shot of some Boston sports legends: David Ortiz, Tom Brady and Jason Varitek.\n\nHere are some more athletes who made the trip to Churchill Downs.\n\nVincent Viola, one of the co-owners of the Florida Panthers is also a co-owner of Derby horse Vino Rosso. A bunch of Panthers players came up to Louisville to root him on.\n\nAaron Rodgers takes some of his offensive linemen and old friends on an annual pilgrimage to the Derby. This is his 10th year in a row making the trip, he told NBC, enough years that he’s started paying attention to horse racing outside of the Triple Crown. He doesn’t know a whole lot about this year’s field, though.\n\n“I like the No. 5 horse based on name only, which is Audible,” Rodgers said. “That’s something I like to do.”\n\nIs it a runway or racetrack? It depends where you are at Churchill Downs. NBC’s Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski are always dressed to the nines and offered a take on what is “in” for the run for the roses, and a preview of what’s fashionable for the summer.\n\nFloral patterns are a favorite, especially busy ones. The print that used to be on your grandmother’s couch, Weir offered: If you can brighten it up, it makes for a dress or tie.\n\nYellow is also apparently in style, thanks to Beyonce’s Coachella performance in a bright yellow hoodie. Look closely, and you’ll see it everywhere at the Derby: ladies’ hats, men’s suits and even more hats.\n\nAnd about those hats: You’re going to see a lot of them this summer between the three jewels of the Triple Crown and the royal wedding. You’re looking for tall hats (like sometimes several feet in height) and sparkly hats.\n\nAnd if you’re in need of inspiration, glance through the the head-wear in this photo gallery.\n\nIt’s a very wet day at the track\n\nThe rain is the main story early in the day at Churchill Downs in Louisville It is currently raining heavily and 67 degrees, according the National Weather Service, which forecasts rain on and off through the rest of the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe track is considered “muddy” — a deeper and slower surface — and could be trending toward “sloppy” as more precipitation comes down.\n\n[Everything you need to know for the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby]\n\nMeanwhile in the grandstand, patrons are scrambling for shelter beneath some covering or trying to acquire a poncho. In the infield, NBC cameras have caught fans to covering themselves with tarps or trying to sidle up beneath an unsuspecting friends’ hat.\n\nIt is the 15th time the Derby has been run on Cinco de Mayo. Decked out sombreros are a popular choice among fans both in person and online.\n\nOn the track, the rain is starting to have an impact on the races. In the fifth race of the day, McCraken, a 4 year-old colt, came all the way from the back of the pack to win in light rain. But the precipitation hasn’t stopped, and the track has gone from fast to good to sloppy in quite a hurry.\n\nRaces Nos. 6 and 8, both on the dirt, were well behind Churchill Down’s typical pace. Horses’ hooves sink deeper into wet surfaces and don’t allow for sturdy stepping.\n\nHorses and jockeys also get chunked with the dirt flying off the track. Jockeys are known to wear up to nine pairs of goggles, pulling them down as the top pair mucks up, to see through the grime.\n\nThis post will be updated throughout the afternoon in the lead up to the run for the roses. In the meantime, here’s everything you need to know about what’s going on in the box office and on the track.\n\nHow to watch: Race coverage begins at noon on NBC Sports Network, and at 2:30 on NBC.

Police seized Navalny by the arms and legs and carried the thrashing activist from Moscow's Pushkin Square, where thousands were gathered for an unauthorized protest.\n\nPolice also used batons against protesters who chanted \"Putin is a thief!\" and \"Russia will be free!\"\n\nDemonstrations under the slogan \"He is not our czar\" took place throughout the country, from Yakutsk in the far northeast to St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad on the fringes of Europe.\n\nThe OVD-Info group, which monitors political repression in Russia, said late Saturday that 1,599 people had been detained at demonstrations in 26 Russian cities. It said 702 were arrested in Moscow alone, and another 232 in St. Petersburg.\n\nMoscow police said about 300 people were detained in the capital, state news agencies said, and there was no official countrywide tally.\n\n\"Let my son go!\" Iraida Nikolaeva screamed, running after police in Moscow when they detained her son. \"He did not do anything! Are you a human or not? Do you live in Russia or not?\"\n\nNavalny was to be charged with disobeying police, an offense that carries a sentence of up to 15 days, news reports said, although when he would face a judge was not immediately clear. Navalny has served several multi-week stretches in jail on similar charges.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, police blocked off a stretch of Nevsky Prospekt as a crowd of about 1,000 marched along the renowned avenue. Video showed some demonstrators being detained. Protesters there shouted \"Jail the tsar!\" the BBC reports.

It's the latest annual report from the government's chief spy, which has faced calls to be more transparent in the wake of the Edward Snowden disclosures into its surveillance programs.\n\nAccording to the figures, 7,512 searches of Americans' calls and messages without a warrant, up by 42 percent on the year prior.\n\nThe government gets these search powers under the controversial section 702 authority, which allows the National Security Agency (NSA) to gather intelligence on foreigners overseas by collecting data from choke points where fiber optic cables owned by telecom giants enter the US. The powers also authorize the collection of data from internet giants and tech companies.\n\nBut data collected under section 702 is near indiscriminate, and it also sweeps up large amounts of data on Americans, who are constitutionally protected from warrantless surveillance.\n\nThe actual number of searches on Americans is likely significantly higher, because the reported figures don't account for searches by other civilian agencies, like the FBI or the Drug Enforcement Administration -- which also don't require a warrant to search the database.\n\n\"We're almost certainly talking about tens of thousands of Americans being queried by FBI but have no clear info on that or the number of Americans whose data is collected,\" said Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at the Project On Government Oversight.\n\nCongress has long asked the government to reveal how many Americans have their data inadvertently collected by the NSA. Both the Obama and Trump administrations refused to disclose how many Americans are caught up in the dragnet.\n\n\"Overall the numbers show that the scale of warrantless surveillance is growing at a significant rate, but ODNI still won't tell Americans how much it affects them,\" said Laperruque.\n\nIt's not the only figure in the report to see a massive increase.\n\nThe NSA targeted 129,080 foreign individuals or groups, representing a rise of 20 percent in the number of targets on the year earlier.\n\nPatrick Toomey, staff attorney at the ACLU's National Security Project, tweeted that the figure was the \"biggest jump on record.\"\n\nThe report also shows a massive spike in the number of collected phone records last year. The details of who calls who and when, collected under the NSA's phone metadata collection programs, was later curtailed when the Freedom Act was ratified in 2015.\n\nLast year, a staggering 534 million call detail records were collected, up from 151 million -- more than a three-fold increase on the year earlier. The figures don't represent the number of Americans whose phone records were collected, and likely includes duplicates, the report said.\n\nThe number of orders to collect phone records, however, remained the same on the previous year.\n\nRobyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs lead at New America's Open Technology Institute, said the intelligence community may have changed interpretations of their legal authorities.\n\n\"The report raises some serious questions if the intelligence community, and the courts may be interpreting their authorities in an overbroad manner to permit too much collection,\" said Greene.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine how you get the same number of targets yet over three-times as many records collected unless you've reinterpreted what constitutes a call detail record,\" Greene added.\n\nThe report also showed a similar pattern with national security letters, a subpoena-like power that can compel tech and phone companies to turn over data on grounds of national security.\n\nAlthough the number of letters increased marginally by 5 percent to 12,762 last year, the number of requests for information more than tripled, indicating that the FBI sought more data per letter than in previous years.\n\nThese letters are particularly controversial because they require no court approval and almost always include a gag order, which prevents the subject of the letter from being informed.\n\nIn recent years, several companies including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo have fought to have details of the secretive letters publicly revealed.\n\nIn 2008, a US court found the National Security Letter statute, amended by the Patriot Act in 2001, was unconstitutional. A separate case in 2013 found that the gag order provision was found to be in breach of the First Amendment, though the government appealed the ruling.\n\nTimothy Barrett, a spokesperson for the ODNI, told ZDNet that the government has not altered its authority to obtain call records and that the number fluctuates from year to year.","author":"Zack Whittaker","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-04T20:51:23.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Zdnet.com"},"urlToImage":"https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/04/58666446-7bad-467d-9131-73606b7ac824/thumbnail/770x578/b68e6c5107e267324f4530ac62a941fc/nsa.jpg","digest":"ZBwPmqlDVocLMhTEWh6DVA==\n"}

The eruptions, along with strong earthquakes and toxic sulfur dioxide gas, have provided a trifecta of natural threats that has prompted massive evacuations and the destruction of at least two homes.\n\nThe new cracks bring the total to eight fissures, the openings in Earth's surface that allow sulfur dioxide gas to seep out and can eventually lead to lava. Geologist Janet Babb told the Associated Press there were eight by Saturday morning. Six were counted on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says this event is far from over, with more earthquakes and eruptions likely that could cover the area with plumes of ash. The agency said it has measured a jarring 477 earthquakes on the island over the last 24 hours, though many were small and likely weren't felt by residents.\n\nOn Friday, back-to-back earthquakes shook the region. The largest, at 6.9 magnitude, was the strongest earthquake felt by the state in decades.\n\nThe quakes are one of the side effects of the erupting volcano as magma makes its way up to the surface.\n\nKilauea is one of five volcanoes on the island — an attraction for the 8.9 million visitors the state sees annually.\n\nArriving tourists on Saturday landed with a mix of excitement and anxiety. The volcanoes, after all, are what many have come to see — maybe just not quite so up close and personal.\n\nAirport officials were monitoring the runways for earthquake damage and jetliners coming from the mainland carried extra fuel so they could divert to Honolulu if the volcano becomes more active.\n\nRental-car customers were warned of the danger lava poses to vehicles.\n\nThe new cracks on Saturday allowed lava to pour out, taking out power lines and trees as it moved toward homes.\n\nResident Julie Woolsey said she evacuated her home late Thursday as a volcanic vent sprouted up on her street in the Leilani Estates neighborhood.\n\nShe told the AP she let her chickens loose, packed up her belongings and loaded her dog into her truck as lava was about 1,000 yards from her home.\n\n“We knew we were building on an active volcano,” she said, but added that she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility. \"We’re hoping our house doesn’t burn down.\"\n\nHer neighborhood was hit again Saturday with the new openings.\n\nResident Shane Turpin posted a series of live videos on Facebook showing a sea of lava moving through a wooded area toward homes. All that was left behind was a trail of smoldering and fiery trees.\n\nAnother video showed lava bubbling and shooting into the sky, almost as though it had boiled over.\n\nHawaii's civil defense department warned residents early Saturday of the new vent openings, saying those in the area should immediately evacuate.\n\n\"The area continues to be unstable with multiple volcanic eruptions happening,\" the department's update for citizens read. \"No one is allowed into the area. Do not attempt to return to your home at this time.\"\n\nAlready, about 1,700 people were ordered to evacuate because of the eruptions and sulfur dioxide gas, which on Friday reached extremely high levels.\n\nExposure to sulfur dioxide gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing.","author":"Christal Hayes, Trevor Hughes","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T23:58:02.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0cee89ee8886fac9b3c59c058621c8a75b6c352/c=336-1312-3400-3043\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636610761601940289-AFP-AFP-14K3N1.jpg","digest":"jPhMKzqa+FvNkBTJGwou8Q==\n"}

Roosevelt was born and the electrical age began with the flip of a switch that lit up one square mile of Lower Manhattan, no horse has won the Kentucky Derby without racing at the age of 2.\n\nThe horse that did it 1882 was the chestnut gelding Apollo, named after the Greek god of many things, including the paradoxical powers to both heal and plague. He caught the favorite Runnymede in deep stretch to win by a half-length and earn the heaping sum of $4,560. No one in attendance could have predicted how long it would be until we had another 3-year-old who did not race at 2 but would still sniff the roses on the first Saturday in May.\n\nEnter Justify, the undefeated chestnut colt with the big white blaze who won three straight races in 2018, including the Santa Anita Derby, and is trained by the Triple Crown-winning Bob Baffert. Maybe Apollo would get the best of him, or maybe enough was enough, and the right horse had finally come along to send the curse the way of the billy goat and the Bambino.\n\nOn Saturday at Churchill Downs, amid a steady and driving rain, Justify proved he was such a horse, making his move around the far turn and then fending off Good Magic to win the 144th Kentucky Derby by two and a half lengths in 2 minutes 4.20 seconds, vanquishing the curse once and for all. He earned a $1,432,000 paycheck for his connections and rewarded his thoroughly soaked backers with $7.80 on a $2 bet to win. Audible finished third.\n\n“Him and American Pharoah and Arrogate, these horses are cut from a different. …” Baffert stopped himself before continuing. “They are just so great,” he said.\n\nThe result, unpredictable with the slop and yet predictable based on the history, marked the sixth year in a row the favorite has won the Derby. It was Baffert’s fifth Derby win.\n\nThe ironman Mike Smith, who at 52 is in the type of shape that makes his younger counterparts ogle or stew, or both, once again lived up to his nickname Big Money Mike by expertly guiding his supremely talented but woefully inexperienced mount to victory in America’s greatest race. It was his second Derby victory — his first coming in 2005 aboard the 50-1 shot Giacomo — in a career overflowing with success.","author":"Melissa Hoppert","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T23:46:45.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/sports/06derby-top/06derby-top-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"NWx6hIss27BH8dfGZlRaqg==\n"}

The couple came to their first meeting for two reasons: both to check out the latest firearms and to stand up for an organization they believe is under attack.\n\n“We really wanted to be able to see this someday,” Joe Henderson said, gesturing to a massive convention center filled with guns and ammunition. “We really wanted to come because of all the negative press.”\n\nThe annual NRA convention is a huge trade show, where firearms enthusiasts ogle the newest products: holsters, scopes, rifles, cowboy boots, commemorative coins. It is a massive marketing opportunity for the NRA, with mammoth photos of its leaders hanging throughout the convention center, offers of discount membership, T-shirts and other swag for sale and booths set up to promote perks such as its wine club.\n\nThere are seminars on firearm safety and Second Amendment law. And there is a major political element to the event, with the president and vice president this year asserting their support for an organization that since a February school shooting that left 17 dead in Parkland, Fla., has been directly challenged by students, activists, corporate America and politicians.\n\nAbout 80,000 people are expected to attend the meeting, which runs through the weekend. Some said they were here just to see guns and wanted nothing to do with politics. Others said they believe the minimum age to buy high-powered firearms such as the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle should be raised to 21, a proposal the NRA has rejected.\n\n[The allure of the AR-15: ‘I know I don’t need it,’ says one recent buyer, but that’s not the point]\n\nMany said they wanted to come this year to show solidarity with the organization and affirm their right to bear arms, which many believe is threatened. They also want to loudly reject what they say is the assertion that anyone linked to the NRA is complicit in mass shootings.\n\n“It just makes me angry when people try to demonize gun owners and NRA members,” said Scott Glenn, a retired law enforcement officer from Salida, Colo. “They try to look at all of us like baby killers and we’re not.”\n\nGlenn and his wife, Lynn, have been NRA members for 18 years. Lynn Glenn is just getting into firearms and purchased a brown purse with a pocket for a concealed weapon. She roamed the floor to see what type of gun she might like to purchase and thinks she probably will get a .38 pistol. The couple sat at a table near a rack of .22 rifles in candy colors: red, purple and yellow.\n\nScott Glenn is disabled, and he wants Lynn to learn how to shoot should the couple have to defend themselves. He thinks what many here said: Before additional gun-control laws are added, the ones on the books must first be enforced. His Second Amendment right, he said, is not up for debate or interpretation.\n\n“The Constitution says ‘shall not be infringed,’ ” he said. “What part of that don’t they understand?”\n\nIn the main hallway of the convention center, attendees looked at the “Wall of Guns,” a case with firearms that were being raffled off. Red sirens flashed atop the case.\n\n“We’re giving away firearms! You could be our next winner!” a man said into a microphone. Tickets started at $20 and went up to $2,000. Orange cards from the Friends of NRA volunteer workshop sat on the case. “Join our team!” they read, with five questions that included, “Do you feel targeted as the bad guy?”\n\nNearby, children and adults sat at an air rifle range, shooting air rifles and pistols at targets. “Did you shoot that thing automatic?” a man asked a boy of about 5, who was putting safety goggles into a bucket.\n\nFor Brandon Theabold, firearms are a family affair. He and his wife have eight children between them, ages 8 to 21, all of whom are familiar with guns. He wore a T-shirt with letters constructed from guns, ammunition and the NRA logo that formed the word “coexist.”\n\n“This is tradition. It’s my heritage,” said Theabold, who traveled from Queen Creek, Ariz. “This is something we can do as a family. . . . It teaches responsibility, teaches safety, it teaches so many things.”\n\nFor the Hendersons, attending was more of a political statement. The couple stood near a large-screen television, watching President Trump’s address to the convention on Friday. They applauded when he said that “Second Amendment rights are under siege” and called on members to vote Republican.\n\n“We do need to stand up. We do need to vote more Republican. We do need to get rid of the people who want to get rid of our rights,” Connie Henderson said.\n\n[At NRA event, Trump embraces its agenda in campaign-style speech]\n\n“I’m not really here for the political stuff,” he said. “I just wanted to see the show. It’s too much of a soap opera.”\n\nThe meeting was just a half-hour drive, so Manasse popped down to check out the latest products and bought a mug and two T-shirts. One read, “Don’t stomp on my flag or I’ll stomp on your a--.”\n\nManasse is a hunter, and he prefers to use a bow rather than a gun. He signed up for the NRA to stay informed about firearms, but he complained that the organization sends out too many fundraising solicitations, mail and emails.\n\n“Way too much mail,” he said. “Save a tree.”\n\nDennis Stewart, of Dalton, Tex., spent 23 years in the Army. His opinions deviate from the NRA on a few issues. The organization stopped short of endorsing a ban on bump stocks, devices used by a gunman who killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival in October to make his firearms behave more like automatic weapons. Stewart thinks bump stocks should be illegal, that civilian background checks should be as robust as those in the military and that the age to own rifles such as the AR-15 should be raised to 21, with exceptions for people in the military or law enforcement.\n\n“The drinking age is 21,” he said. “There’s no point in buying an AR at 18.”\n\nAcross the hall stood a huge set for NRA TV, the organization’s media outlet, which broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and has become a staunch and open defender of the Second Amendment — against all perceived enemies.\n\n“I think they’re spot on and refuse to give up our rights,” Glenn said.\n\nMichele Rivera thinks NRA TV can be “a little aggressive” but that they are speaking to like-minded people.\n\n“To your average Joe, they’re going to look at that and say, ‘That’s crazy,’ because they don’t have the same mentality,” Rivera said. “This is how we feel.”\n\nRivera and others said they are horrified by the recent spate of mass shootings. She believes that schools should be better protected with security measures such as armed guards.\n\nShe was excited to come to the convention so she could meet up with people who have the same beliefs as she does; she said she feels as though there are not many where she lives in New Jersey.

The friendship between our two peoples will not be tainted by disrespect and excessiveness. All my thoughts go to the victims of November 13.\"\n\nTrump went on to say things might have been different had Parisians in the cafes under attack had been armed.\n\n\"If one employee or just one patron had a gun, or if one person in this room had been there with a gun, aimed at the opposite direction, the terrorists would have fled or been shot. And it would have been a whole different story,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Élysée palace responded to that comment by saying, \"The free flow of arms within society does not constitute a shield against terrorist attacks. It can instead facilitate the planning of this type of attack.\"\n\nAnd the French ambassador to the United Nations, Gérard Araud, tweeted: \"The statistics of the people killed by guns don't convince France to change its guns laws.\"\n\nThe attackers, armed with assault rifles and explosives, targeted six locations across the city. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nTrump also compared an unnamed London hospital to a \"war zone\" in the NRA speech, saying that despite tough gun laws in the United Kingdom, it has blood all over the floors from victims of knife attacks.\n\n\"They don't have guns. They have knives and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital,\" Trump said. \"They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital ... knives, knives, knives. London hasn't been used to that. They're getting used to that. It's pretty tough.\"\n\nBritish officialdom did not push back. London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office declined to comment to CNN following Trump's remarks.\n\nBut Charlie Falconer, who retired as the United Kingdom's secretary of justice in 2016, tweeted Saturday: \"US murder rate over 5 times higher than the UK's. There isn't a person in the whole world (with the possible exception of the President of the US, and he's probably lying) who believes the way to reduce our murder rate is to make it easier to get guns.\"\n\nAmid the furor over Trump's comments, Griffiths tweeted Saturday: \"Happy to invite Mr Trump to my (prestigious) hospital to meet with our mayor and police commissioner to discuss our successes in violence reduction in London.\"\n\nTrump and British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke by phone Saturday. According to the White House, they discussed China trade, North Korea, Iran and Trump's upcoming visit to Britain. It's unknown whether they talked about Trump's remarks to the NRA.","author":"Ralph Ellis, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T01:02:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180504161938-03-trump-nra-convention-0504-super-tease.jpg","digest":"KPiYTDh3Nbt/ABNNIjoTHQ==\n"}

American Airlines and Qantas both told Business Insider they had received the letter.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the White House deemed this action \"Chinese political correctness.\"\n\n\"This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies,\" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in the statement.\n\n\"The United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content,\" the statement read.\n\nWhile Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Regions of China, Taiwan is a democratic, self-ruled island. But it is one that China holds a claim to.\n\nUnder the \"One China\" policy, Beijing considers Taiwan to be a province of China, one that will eventually be fully reunified — by force, if necessary. China is adamant about this and frequently seeks to assert its claim to Taiwan on the global stage which the US appears to be pushing back on.\n\n\"We call on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens,\" the press secretary's statement read. \"China's internal Internet repression is world-famous. China's efforts to export its censorship and political correctness to Americans and the rest of the free world will be resisted.\"\n\nThe US State Department previously told Business Insider this week it had raised \"strong concerns\" with Chinese authorities in Beijing and \"will consider taking appropriate action if necessary in response to unfair Chinese actions.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Delta Air Lines was censured by China's CAA for listing both Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website. The agency demanded an \"immediate and public apology,\" and the airline responded by saying it had made a \"grave mistake\" and altered the title of its destination listings from \"Country\" to \"Country/Region.\"\n\nAfter that incident, China ordered all foreign airlines to review their websites and reportedly called in representatives from 25 air carriers to demand they remove references to Taiwan as a country.\n\nLufthansa since changed its website to show Taiwan as a province of China while British Airways repeatedly changed its site back and forth. Qantas found an\"oversight\" that listed some Chinese territories as countries and told Business Insider at the time they were \"correcting this error,\" but the company did not respond to questions this week as to whether this correction was ever made or if the correction was reversed.\n\nDozens of airlines still list Taiwan as its own country but most recipients of the April letter remain unknown to the public, and a number of international airlines did not respond to questions sent by Business Insider this week.\n\nBut airlines aren't the only foreign companies the Chinese government has tried to exert its influence over.\n\nThe hotel chain Marriott was forced to shut down the Chinese version of its website for a week and fast-fashion retailer Zara was ordered to complete a \"self-inspection\" and turn in a rectification report when the companies' websites listed certain areas as countries earlier this year.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump ran against political correctness in the United States. He will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens. On April 25, the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration sent a letter to 36 foreign air carriers, including a number of American carriers. This notice demanded that carriers change how \"Taiwan,\" \"Hong Kong,\" and \"Macao\" are identified on their websites and in their promotional material so that the references fall in line with the Communist Party's standards. This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies. China's internal Internet repression is world-famous. China's efforts to export its censorship and political correctness to Americans and the rest of the free world will be resisted. The United States respects the broad freedom private companies have in their interactions with their customers, both in the United States and abroad. This respect is essential for a robust global marketplace. The United States strongly objects to China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of a political nature in their publicly available content. We call on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens.","author":"Tara Francis Chan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T00:44:02.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5aee489f19ee8647008b4917-640-320.jpg","digest":"KHdSLNU4FRFEjs5cMtW9Gg==\n"}

Already a protective big sister, Charlotte cradles Louis in her lap and places a sweet kiss on her sleeping baby brother’s head.\n\nThe solo photo of Louis was taken on April 26, just three days after his birth.

From birthday shots to first day of school moments, the royal mom of three can usually be found behind the camera capturing her family’s special memories.\n\nThe sweet shot of Charlotte and Louis is part of a family tradition. The photo is very similar to the portraits Kate took of a then one-month-old Princess Charlotte with big brother Prince George in June 2015.\n\nThe royal parents took the same low-key route for the siblings’ first photos together with Kate as the photographer. She even got little George to plant a sweet kiss on his sister’s head in one of the shots. The photos were also taken in a familiar place — the couple’s country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk, England.\n\nGeorge’s very first portrait, which was taken by grandpa Michael Middleton at the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, England, had an even more casual feel. The sweet shots were taken in the Middleton’s backyard and even featured the family’s cocker spaniel, Lupo and the Middleton’s dog Tilly.\n\nLouis’ next big appearance will be at his upcoming royal christening, which will likely occur in July.

The younger teen offers to retrieve the email confirming their reservations on the tour.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, do that, and then we’ll get you out of here,” the officer shown in the video said.\n\nThe officer adds: “People were just worried because you guys were real quiet and they didn’t know who you were because you guys didn’t show up with parents or any of that stuff,” the officer says to the teens.\n\nBy then, however, their tour group had moved on without them and the brothers left the campus in Fort Collins, a city of about 161,000 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, and returned home to New Mexico.\n\n“I think it’s pretty discriminatory,” 19-year-old Thomas Kanewakeron Gray said Thursday. “Me and my brother just stayed to ourselves the whole time. I guess that was scaring people; that we were just quiet.”\n\nAccording to the recording, the caller told a dispatcher that the teens arrived late in the tour and wouldn’t respond to questions about their names or what they wanted to study at the school.\n\n“They are not, definitely not, a part of the tour,” said the woman, identified in a police report as a 45-year-old white woman from Colorado. “And their behavior is just really odd. And I’ve never called, ever, about anybody. But they joined our tour. They won’t give their names. And when I ask them what they were wanting to study, like everything they were saying, they were lying the whole time.”\n\nThe woman also repeatedly told the dispatcher that her concern could be “completely paranoid” and apologized “if it’s nothing.”\n\nOther than saying the teens were wearing all black clothing with “dark stuff on it,” the caller did not physically describe them until questioned by the dispatcher. She described their clothing as having a “weird symbolism or wording on it.”\n\nIt appears at least one of the brothers was wearing a T-shirt for a death metal band called Cattle Decapitation. On its Facebook page, the band offered the teens “free guest list spots to our shows for life.”\n\nThe caller’s name was redacted in the police report, along with the teenagers’ names.\n\nThe teens’ mother, Lorraine Gray, said Friday that the family has received apologetic messages from the university and is aware of its offer to return to the school for a VIP tour. However, she said they are not ready to respond, given that she and her sons have not had the opportunity to fully discuss the situation.\n\nThe younger son is a senior at Santa Fe Indian School, which is about a 30-minute drive from the family home and where he stays in a dorm during the week with other Native American students from tribes across the United States. He returned to the school early Tuesday morning, just hours after he and his older brother arrived home from their Colorado trip.\n\nThe older brother is currently a student at Northern New Mexico College in Espanola and hoped to transfer.\n\nThe siblings saved until they had enough money to drive the roughly seven hours from the family’s home in Santa Cruz, New Mexico to Fort Collins for the tour.\n\nThe older brother said the school was their first choice, because of its proximity to Denver, where they could attend concerts. The brothers, both Mohawk, are musicians, and study contemporary and traditional music.\n\nThe brothers’ ordeal marks the latest in a series of incidences nationwide spotlighting treatment minorities often face in everyday circumstances, including the arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia who were handcuffed and taken to jail after a worker said they had refused to buy anything or leave.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Hazards from new volcanic cracks that opened Saturday have left residents on edge and hurrying to find shelter. The eruption, along with strong earthquakes and toxic sulfur dioxide gas, has provided a trifecta of natural threats.\n\nAt least two new eruption points opened up Saturday, allowing molten lava to escape from underground, shoot into the air and slowly take out everything in its path. The new cracks bring the total to eight fissures, the openings in Earth's surface that allow sulfur dioxide gas to seep out and can eventually lead to lava, according to the Associated Press. Six were counted on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says this event is far from over, with more earthquakes and eruptions likely that could cover the area with plumes of ash. The agency said it has measured a jarring 477 earthquakes on the island over the last 24 hours, though many were small and likely weren't felt by residents.\n\nOn Friday, back-to-back earthquakes shook the region. The largest, a 6.9 magnitude, was the strongest earthquake felt by the state in decades.\n\nThe quakes are one of the side effects of the erupting volcano as magma makes its way up to the surface.\n\nKilauea is one of five volcanoes on the island — an attraction for the 8.9 million visitors the state sees annually.\n\nArriving tourists on Saturday landed with a mix of excitement and anxiety. The volcanoes, after all, are what many have come to see — maybe just not quite so up close and personal.\n\nAirport officials were monitoring the runways for earthquake damage and jetliners coming from the mainland carried extra fuel so they could divert to Honolulu if the volcano becomes more active.\n\nRental-car customers were warned of the danger lava poses to vehicles.\n\nThe new cracks on Saturday allowed lava to pour out, taking out power lines and trees as it moved toward homes.\n\nResident Julie Woolsey said she evacuated her home late Thursday as a volcanic vent sprouted up on her street in the Leilani Estates neighborhood.\n\nShe told the AP she let her chickens loose, packed up her belongings and loaded her dog into her truck as lava was about 1,000 yards from her home.\n\n“We knew we were building on an active volcano,” she said, but added that she thought the danger from lava was a remote possibility. \"We’re hoping our house doesn’t burn down.\"\n\nHer neighborhood was hit again Saturday with the new vent openings. Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder told the AP five homes have burned to the ground over the last two days since lava started pouring into the subdivision.\n\nResident Shane Turpin posted a series of live videos on Facebook showing a sea of lava moving through a wooded area toward homes. All that was left behind was a trail of smoldering and fiery trees.\n\nAnother video showed lava bubbling and shooting into the sky, almost as though it had boiled over.\n\nHawaii's civil defense department warned residents early Saturday of the new vent openings, saying those in the area should immediately evacuate.\n\n\"The area continues to be unstable with multiple volcanic eruptions happening,\" the department's update for citizens read. \"No one is allowed into the area. Do not attempt to return to your home at this time.\"\n\nAlready, about 1,700 people were ordered to evacuate because of the eruptions and sulfur dioxide gas, which on Friday reached extremely high levels.\n\nExposure to sulfur dioxide gas can cause irritation or burns, sore throats, runny noses, burning eyes and coughing.","author":"Christal Hayes, Trevor Hughes","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T01:38:18.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0cee89ee8886fac9b3c59c058621c8a75b6c352/c=336-1312-3400-3043\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636610761601940289-AFP-AFP-14K3N1.jpg","digest":"72q+gbVC+m5WIk3XpVEJPg==\n"}

Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.\n\nThe Republicans cautioned that the surveys, designed to offer a snapshot of the race, were conducted over a brief period of time and may be overstating Blankenship’s support.\n\nStill, Blankenship’s rivals and other Republicans are alarmed. Many are convinced that a Blankenship win, coming just months after the disastrous Alabama Senate race, would destroy the party’s prospects of defeating Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November.\n\nSome Republicans involved in the race said they were hoping the White House would intervene ahead of the Tuesday primary, though it remains unclear whether it will do so.\n\nOn Thursday, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., sent out a tweet asking “the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship.”\n\n“No more fumbles like Alabama,” he added. “We need to win in November.”\n\nMorrisey, who’d largely been ignoring Blankenship, has suddenly turned his fire on the coal baron. On Saturday, Morrisey’s campaign released a 30-second robocall to West Virginia voters blasting Blankenship over an array of issues. The call described Blankenship as a “convicted criminal” who didn’t vote for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. It also highlighted his Nevada residency.\n\n“A vote for Blankenship is a vote to advance liberal positions, higher taxes, and abortion on-demand,” the voiceover says. “That’s because Blankenship would get crushed in November.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Morrisey is slated to hold a press conference to “talk about Don Blankenship's criminal record, his significant legal issues, and how his candidacy threatens West Virginia's conservative agenda,” according to a media advisory his campaign sent out over the weekend.\n\n“We have run hard from beginning to end and we are encouraged by the desperation we are seeing from our opposition,” he said in a text message.\n\nNational Republicans have sought to prevent Blankenship from winning the nomination. An outside group aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mountain Families PAC, has spent $1.3 million on a TV ad campaign targeting the former prisoner. On Friday afternoon, the group began a digital advertisement telling West Virginians, “Don’t vote Don Blankenship.”\n\nThe offensive bears similarities to the ultimately unsuccessful one the party launched against former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore in last year’s Alabama Senate race. Moore beat back the national GOP campaign against him and went on to lose the general election to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nBlankenship has responded in kind, launching a slash-and-burn campaign targeting McConnell.\n\nHis scorching attacks have veered into deeply personal, even racially-charged territory.\n\nThis week, Blankenship began airing a TV commercial labeling McConnell “Cocaine Mitch,” an apparent reference to a 2014 report that drugs were once found aboard a shipping vessel owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, Taiwanese-born Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Then, a few days later, Blankenship began airing another spot declaring that McConnell’s “China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.”\n\nThe president has yet to speak out against Blankenship, though earlier this spring he held a tax reform-focused event in which he sat next to Jenkins and Morrisey — a deliberate move designed to show that he preferred either of them win the nomination.\n\nBut after lining up behind losing candidates in Alabama and Pennsylvania races — electoral defeats that ultimately proved embarrassing to Trump, many Republicans are skeptical that he will forcefully repudiate Blankenship ahead of the primary.\n\nParticularly concerning to Republicans is Blankenship’s TV spending. Over the final six days of the race, the self-funding coal baron is set to spend over $640,000 on commercials, according to media buying totals – more than Jenkins and Morrisey combined. Blankenship has spent over $2.5 million on TV ads in total, far more than his rivals.\n\nWhat is also distressing, senior Republicans say, is that Jenkins and Morrisey spent nearly all of the campaign savaging each other. Further complicating matters is that a Democratic super PAC, Duty and Country, has invested $1.8 million targeting Jenkins in an effort to keep him from winning the GOP primary, convinced that he would pose a formidable challenge to Manchin.\n\nThe bloodbath may ultimately be to the benefit of Blankenship, who has faced far fewer incoming attacks.\n\nAndy Seré, a Jenkins strategist, argued that Morrisey’s attacks against Jenkins “have helped Blankenship,” and that with his last-minute attacks against Blankenship, “Morrisey is scrambling to fix the mess he and his enablers made.”\n\n“But West Virginians see through it,” Sere added. “We are confident the Schumer-Morrisey alliance will fail and Evan Jenkins will prevail.\"","author":"ALEX ISENSTADT","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T01:36:21.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/4f/c6/7e8ce66b47d78d2dea43e94a1446/180505blankernshipap-18018815524905.jpg","digest":"eMB4Iqamqaap9Pgy4CnZ4A==\n"}

Game 3 became an instant classic that had everything an NBA fan could ask for: A buzzer-beater, overtime, and a more poised team overcoming the mistakes of a young one.\n\nThe reality of Game 3 is that the 76ers probably should have won. There are never guarantees in basketball, but their own mistakes and lack of execution at the end of the game cost them. Give the Celtics credit -- they did everything to force that -- but the 76ers walked right into those mistakes and now face a deficit that no team in NBA history has overcome.\n\nHere are a few takeaways from the game.\n\nThe 76ers may have cost themselves the game, but at one point it looked like they had saved themselves. They forced overtime with a shot that, had Marco Belinelli been a little farther back, would have won them the game. Belinelli has always been known for making tough looks, but this fadeaway from the corner was ridiculous.\n\nThe shot counted as a two, but what followed was honestly hilarious. The in-arena ops thought Belinelli had just won the game so they started to shoot out confetti. Except he hadn't. So they had to clean up all the confetti off the floor, but this didn't stop the confetti that was still floating down from the ceiling.\n\nOvertime was delayed a bit while they cleaned the floor, and the culprit for all of this was wearing a T-shirt that only made it funnier.\n\nThis raises an important question. If the 76ers had won, would they have had any confetti to shoot out?\n\nThe 76ers are a young team, which historically can be prone to certain kinds of mistakes -- especially against a team like the Celtics, who are so incredible at executing down the stretch. Philadelphia had a lot of execution problems, but nothing was as costly as their turnovers. Consider the end of regulation.\n\nThe game was tied and Philadelphia had the ball. They win with a basket here, but if they miss then they're probably going to overtime anyway. It's really a no-lose situation. However, what followed was an incredible miscommunication that put an obscene amount of pressure on themselves.\n\nThis miscue appears to come on the part of Simmons. Not only is he not even looking for the ball when Redick tries to give it back to him, but he barrels into Joel Embiid while trying to run around the screen attempt. The Celtics take the ball back up the court to give themselves the lead.\n\nPhilly was able to tie the game back up and send it to overtime on a miraculous Marco Belinelli jumper, but their execution mistakes merely continued as the game went on.\n\nUp by a point in the extra frame, the 76ers were once again in control of the game. They ran the clock down and posted up Joel Embiid. He was stonewalled, but Simmons was able to pull down the rebound. Instead of dribbling the ball back out, or taking the foul to shoot free throws, he instead attempted a hasty putback.\n\nThe shot fell short, giving the Celtics another chance to win the game. They didn't waste it, with a fantastic lob play to set up Al Horford's go-ahead basket.\n\nThe 76ers are still in control of their destiny at this point. They just have to make a basket, and they can end this game as winners of a drama-filled Game 3. Instead, they once again turned the ball over at a crucial moment. This time it was Simmons throwing the ball away as he tried to get it to Embiid.\n\nThis is youth falling short in a playoff setting. It's not a young team failing due to the bright lights, but rather desperation taking over and leading to dumb mistakes against a world-class defense. Every time the 76ers had control, they would proceed to give that control right back to the Celtics. They had so many chances to win the game late and just couldn't come through.\n\nOn paper, it looks like Embiid played well. He had 22 points, 19 rebounds, and two highlight poster dunks that are going to be showing up on highlight reels for his entire career. First, he baptized Aron Baynes with something so nasty that it requires a warning: Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThen Embiid tried to break Horford's hand by putting him on the poster list. That's two posters in a single game for \"The Process.\"\n\nHowever, highlights and numbers aside, this was a bad game for Embiid. His defense wasn't anywhere near the necessary level for the 76ers. Too often he was caught out of position and leaving open lanes for the Celtics to drive through. More than once Terry Rozier, or even Baynes, found themselves with nothing but paint on the way to the rim.\n\nOn the eventual game-winner, Embiid left Horford on a switch so he could guard Brown on the perimeter. This set up the lob play for Horford with Embiid nowhere near the basket. At every turn this series, Horford has outplayed Embiid and it's just been a matchup nightmare for him. Even Saturday, with his 22 points, it took 26 shots to get there. He was an efficiency nightmare.\n\nThe 76ers late-game execution failings had a lot to do with Philadelphia's inability to go to Embiid in the post. Horford and Baynes played him tight and Embiid would force up bad looks in response. This inefficient basketball was exactly what Boston wanted to see from Embiid. More than once, Embiid would post up and then force a one-footed fadeaway as the shot clock went off because he held the ball too long.\n\nGive credit to the Celtics defense, and their big men, because they're the ones forcing this inefficiency out of him. They will give Embiid as many highlights as he wants if he continues to shoot like this.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T01:25:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Cbssports.com"},"urlToImage":"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2018/05/06/4decf29b-756c-4bb1-a31a-4d48e3296a48/thumbnail/770x433/3eba58045dd99d5ae99ec402d0a48841/al-horford-steals-it-from-embiid.jpg","digest":"1SZBUkp9XluR2Nb2X2FgfA==\n"}

After the terrifying shooting spree Friday afternoon, which injured two people and left at least seven vehicles with bullet holes, Harbour killed himself.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Harbour perched himself on the side of Georgia 365, just outside Atlanta. Hiding in the wooded area made him harder to see, Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch said.\n\nHe had with him an arsenal of at least five guns and more than 3,000 round of ammunition, Couch said.\n\nHarbour opened fire at passing vehicles driving northbound and hit at least seven. Two people — a 72-year-old man and a 54-year-old man — were shot. Another woman was injured due to broken glass after a bullet hit her windshield.\n\nThe two men were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after being hit in the hip and leg.\n\nBoth called 911 about noon to report the shooting. Around that time, Couch said, authorities saw a suspicious vehicle pulling out of the woodline along the highway.\n\nTroopers followed the vehicle and tried to make a traffic stop, but Harbour wasn't slowing down, Couch said.\n\nAfter a short chase, his vehicle came to a stop in the median of the highway.\n\nDeputies and troopers approached the stopped vehicle and found Harbour with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was transported to a local hospital where he later died.\n\nAuthorities still don't have a motive but searched his home for clues.\n\nCouch said investigators seized electronics and found \"disturbing\" hand-written documents that indicated Harbour \"idolized\" the Parkland shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz, who is being charged in the Valentine's Day killings of 17 people at a high school in Florida.\n\n\"He called Nikolas Cruz a hero and that Cruz gave him courage and confidence,\" Couch said, adding, \"It appeared [Harbour] was targeting all Americans. Why? I don't know.\"\n\nCouch said that writings showed that Harbour had an overall hatred for everyone. As a result, he didn't target any specific ethnic group during his shooting spree on Friday, instead, apparently shooting at anyone who crossed his path.\n\nHarbour lived with his parents in Snellville.\n\nDetectives, speaking with his parents Friday night, learned that he was a landscaper, but, according to Couch, there was nothing within his employment history that specifically led him to Hall County or that particular stretch of highway.\n\nAn additional search of his background indicated there was no arrest history or any type of background of violence for Harbour.\n\nCouch said he did not believe the weapons were stolen.\n\nMichael King reports for WXIA-TV in Atlanta; Christal Hayes reports for USA TODAY in McLean, Va.","author":"Michael King, Christal Hayes","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T01:24:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f6c38ec682492fcb2cbb080bda055e6b66320b6/c=0-0-1365-768\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/01/USATODAY/usatsports/georgia-car.jpg","digest":"zbEk9fCXk0x+mAAgH5IoDg==\n"}

He’s able just to keep running.”\n\n“His mechanics,” Baffert said. “He just covers the ground.”\n\n“It takes a lot to try and keep up with him, and then you’ve got to try to run him down after that,” Smith said. “You’ve got to let a fast horse be fast sometimes.”\n\n[Audible finishes third, but America still gets a free audio book]\n\nAll of the above meant that after some palpitations over some harrowing early fractions of 22.24 and 45.77 seconds, Baffert spent the last 100 yards of the race in another state: awe.\n\n“I knew that last eighth, he was going to win, and I was just in awe of the performance,” he said. “I mean, that’s the best Kentucky Derby-winning performance that I’ve brought up here. He just put himself up there with the greats.”\n\nOff as the 5-2 favorite and free from the gate sans trouble to match the jockey and trainer’s fondest wish, Justify hurriedly found himself on the cusp of the lead, next to the anticipated early pacer, Promises Fulfilled. They rounded the first turn of the mile and a quarter together through rain so persistent it soaked the 157,813 in attendance and bordered upon grotesque, and they got to the backstretch before Justify commenced making sure the race would be about him — one way or another. Baffert cringed at that opening 22: “Wow.” He felt relieved at seeing a 46 for the next fraction until his wife, Jill, corrected him to say it had been 45.\n\n“ ‘I think they slowed it down,’ ” he recalled telling her. “She said, ‘No, that’s 45 and change.’ That’s not good. And after that I was just like, ‘Wow, this poor little horse, he’s going to lay down. There’s no way. He’s going to lay down.’ Man, I’ve been fretting all week, trying to get this big horse there. I mean, it’s like having LeBron James on your team. If you have LeBron, you’d better win a championship with him.”\n\nIn a field Baffert called loaded with quality and the “toughest bunch I’ve ever been involved with,” almost nobody came for Justify, save for Good Magic and Audible for peeks in the stretch. Perhaps the biggest mystery and curiosity in a race full of them, the second choice Mendelssohn wound up last. It was all heady business given that the 2017 Breeders’ Cup had passed and the new year had dawned and gotten going and then gone on a good while before Justify even raced.\n\nHe began Feb. 18, then followed March 11 and April 7, all at Santa Anita and the third one in the Santa Anita Derby, a three-length smash against the strong Bolt d’Oro. In those three races, he had beaten a combined 14 horses. For that maiden race in February, he won by 9½ lengths, and Baffert said, “I thought the timer was wrong.” Of particular note might have been that race March 11, when he ran in the mud and seemed to relish it. Come Saturday, with its three inches of deluge and its muddled 2:04.20 winner’s time, he would race against five more horses than he had in his entire career, yet he and those around him would relish it even more.\n\nThose around him were numerous.\n\n[The best photos from Saturday’s Kentucky Derby]\n\nJustify’s ownership group fairly crowded the interview dais Saturday evening. One of the bunch — former trainer Elliott Walden, who runs WinStar Farm — had to request an extra chair. The mass included the operations China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners, Starlight Racing and WinStar Farm, and the mass also owns Audible. The group included even the prime minister of Saint Lucia, Allen Chastanet, seated next to Teo Ah Khing of China Horse Club, whose group has begun a horse racing project in that Caribbean country.\n\n“I’m just along for the ride,” said Starlight Racing’s Jack Wolf, the first Louisvillian to own a Derby winner in 104 years.\n\n“I saw the way [Baffert] looked at the horse [early on] and the way he was acting around the barn,” said Solomon Kumin of Head of Plains Partners. “I came back and said, ‘This has got to be the real deal.’ ”\n\n“Thank you, America,” said Teo, a Malaysian-born Harvard graduate and architect. “The win today is the equivalent to a gold medal in the Olympics for the China Horse Club and for the Chinese.”\n\nAll the eight men in the row of winners, counting Baffert and Smith, did fret to various degrees as to the meaning of the appalling weather. Baffert found solace in Justify’s coolness in the paddock. Smith entered the gates having won one of his first 23 Derby entries, aboard absurd long shot Giacomo in 2005, and having finished an aching second in 2012 aboard Baffert’s beloved Bodemeister.\n\n“I knew if I could get him out of there, just get him into a big rhythm,” Smith said, “I mean, he can go fast, because that’s how good he is.” Into the clear, Smith sighed relief. He thought, “ ‘You do it from here, man.’ I basically just stayed out of the way and just kept a leg on each side and my mind in the middle.”\n\nAfter the 45, Smith let Justify get some air. Asking Justify again toward the far turn, Smith found a willing teammate. He had been “losing sleep, in a good way” ever since Baffert put him on Justify for his second race, and now his daydream was coming true. “Going 45 and still finishing like he did was just incredible,” Smith said.\n\n“Again, he’s just way above average,” said Smith, whose silks looked oddly clean.\n\n“Not only that,” Baffert stopped himself at one point, “he’s the most beautiful horse. He is a specimen of a horse. . . . He has that presence about him. That’s one thing about every day at Santa Anita, everybody says, ‘Who’s that?’ And that’s the only one I know for sure who it is.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/chuck.culpepper1","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T00:15:46.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PZEXOABF1f5mdTesLDm8RvYh1BY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZYTGZCQXQI6RNZFSLEJ7Y6KJQ.jpg","digest":"kcd6KYgrb2DNqiO1MLTu5w==\n"}

The special counsel's office had asked to reschedule Concord's appearance because it hadn't properly served the company with a summons.\n\n\"I find it disturbing that in your first communication you are already behaving in a manner that is inconsistent with the practices of the Department of Justice,\" Eric Dubelier, a US attorney from the law firm Reed Smith that represents Concord, wrote to prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, according to an April 20 email he submitted to the court.\n\nDubelier was responding to Rhee's attempt to communicate with Concord by sending him a legal document without first asking if he'd accept it on Concord's behalf. In US courts, defendants, even those in other countries, must receive formal notice of the charges against them before a case can proceed, unless a judge steps in. Mueller's team has faced difficulties in pursuing the criminal case against 13 Russians and three Russian entities, including Concord, since charging them i n February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election using social media.

But after they joined the tour group, a parent “called campus police because she was nervous about the presence of two young men who joined the tour while it was in progress,” said the college statement.\n\nA 911 call from the woman complained about the fact that they were quiet and that their clothing had “dark stuff on it, like dark things.” One wore a T-shirt and the other a sweatshirt with band logos.\n\nFollowing the call, they were pulled aside and patted down by campus police, then released. It was too late for them to rejoin the tour, and they returned home.\n\nThe boys’ mother, Lorraine Kahneratokwas Gray, complained on Facebook: “My two teenagers were ‘patted down,’ and my 17-year-old ordered to ‘empty his pockets,’ then immediately ordered to ‘keep his hands out of his pockets,’ until he was forced to ask, ‘Which one do you want me to do?’ All of this treatment because some ‘nervous mother’ didn’t like how my boys looked and was unsettled by their quiet presence?”\n\n“I was concerned for my sons’ safety and advised them to return home immediately,” she told the radio station. “Our family is shocked and saddened over this incident of racial profiling, and disappointed that the school didn’t take a more proactive stand in protecting my boys from being shamed in this hostile way.”\n\nShe told a local CNN affiliate: “It breaks my heart, because they didn’t do anything to warrant that. They’re walking on their own ancestors’ land, so it breaks my heart.”\n\nThe boys’ mother lamented to The Denver Post that it’s “one of their first experiences out in the real world and they run into this cruel world.” She added, “That’s why we have to speak out: my sons need to find the courage to speak out.”\n\n“I think it’s pretty discriminatory,” her son Thomas said Thursday, The Associated Press reported. “Me and my brother just stayed to ourselves the whole time. I guess that was scaring people, that we were just quiet.”\n\nThe brothers and their mother have received a written apology from the student who was running the tour. She said that there was “absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about that tour” and that she was unaware of what had happened until the end of the tour.\n\nOn Thursday, Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, who also chairs Colorado’s Commission of Indian Affairs, issued a statement condemning the incident and said she hoped the brothers would still consider coming to the state for school.\n\nThe statement from the university noted: “The emotions released have ranged from sadness to frustration to anger, all flowing from a reservoir of sympathy created by imagining ourselves or our children in this situation. Two young men, through no fault of their own, wound up frightened and humiliated because another campus visitor was concerned about their clothes and overall demeanor, which appears to have simply been shyness. The very idea that someone — anyone — might ‘look’ like they don’t belong on a CSU Admissions tour is anathema.”","author":"Mary Papenfuss","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T04:46:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-huffington-post","name":"The Huffington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aed23402000004200b90887.jpeg?cache=DiFizLTbLk\u0026ops=1200_630","digest":"G+hqmA5eZxgOHkze/6JbIA==\n"}

Toronto is now on the clock, and has to do it in Cleveland.","title":"NBA playoffs live: Celtics push 76ers to the brink; Cavaliers can smell blood","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/05/nba-playoffs-live-celtics-76ers-raptors-cavaliers-game-3/","text":"The Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors both face 2-0 holes as they enter Game 3 against the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively. Follow along here for the latest analysis and commentary from The Post’s NBA reporter Tim Bontemps, and ask him questions in the comments section. Catch up on yesterday’s games here.\n\nA 15-6 run for the Raptors to start the fourth quarter has Toronto back within seven, 87-80, with a little over seven minutes to go in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Raptors have fought admirably, despite trailing the entire game, to give themselves a chance here in the fourth quarter. A loss, obviously, would all but end Toronto’s season.\n\nEven a win would leave the Raptors in a tough spot — that’s what happens when a team loses the first two games on its home court. But at least they’d have a chance in the series.\n\nThe next eight minutes will determine if the Raptors can give themselves one.\n\nSo why did Raptors Coach Dwane Casey stick with his starting lineup featuring that very matchup?\n\nHe just subbed in Serge Ibaka for Valanciunas, but it does make you wonder why the move wasn’t to start Ibaka and bring Valanciunas off the bench. It would seem that having Valanciunas in the game against Tristan Thompson, and Ibaka against Love, would make more sense.\n\nThat said, it might not matter given how Love is playing. After scoring a playoff-high 31 points in Game 2, Love has 19 points and 13 rebounds so far in Game 3 as the lead has been pushed to 14 through three quarters.\n\nLeBron James is playing like someone who smells blood in the water.\n\nWith Cleveland holding a 2-0 lead over Toronto, the Cavaliers have a chance to all but end this series with one more victory. James is doing his best to get that win.\n\nAt halftime, Cleveland leads 55-40, a lead that was built by the Cavaliers going on a 16-4 run over the first 6:53 of the game, and then going on a 16-2 run over the final 5:07 of the first half. That’s a 32-6 advantage for Cleveland over exactly 12 minutes.\n\nJames, as usual, has been at the heart of all of it. He has 15 points, four rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block in 21 minutes. Kevin Love added 12 points and 11 rebounds, while Kyle Korver had 12 points, two rebounds and two assists.\n\nDeMar DeRozan, on the other hand, has been awful. He has three points on 1-for-9 shooting, and is a game-worst minus-22. C.J. Miles actually leads the Raptors in scoring with eight points off the bench.\n\nHaving lost the first two games of their Eastern Conference semifinal series at home, Toronto made a lineup change as the series shifted to Cleveland for Game 3.\n\nFred VanVleet, Toronto’s superb sixth man, entered the starting lineup, with Raptors Coach Dwane Casey choosing to bring Serge Ibaka off the bench instead. The small lineup didn’t exactly work as Casey intended, with Cleveland jumping out to a 16-4 lead.\n\nBut the Raptors managed to cut the Cavaliers’ lead to 24-19 after one thanks to a 15-8 run to end the quarter, largely executed with Ibaka playing center. After failing to get a block in either of the first two games of the series, Ibaka had two in the first quarter alone to help spark Toronto’s run to get back into the game.\n\nIn a wild, wacky and thrilling game, the Celtics emerged with a heart-stopping 101-98 overtime victory over the Sixers in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal. The win gives the Celtics a 3-0 lead in this best-of-seven series, a lead no team has ever given up in an NBA playoff series.\n\nBoston looked like it won in regulation when Philadelphia committed a turnover that led to a Jaylen Brown dunk with 1.8 seconds left to give the Celtics a two-point lead. But Marco Belinelli hit a jumper in the corner right in front of the Sixers’ bench to tie the game and send it to overtime.\n\nPhiladelphia then looked like it was in control when it led by one with the ball with 42.5 seconds left. But Joel Embiid missed a shot in the lane, and when Ben Simmons got the offensive rebound, he chose to go up for a putback instead of pulling the ball back out, and missed as the shot clock was turned off.\n\nBoston then got the rebound and, after bringing the ball up and calling timeout, Marcus Morris threw a perfect inbounds pass to Al Horford, who had expertly sealed his defender, Robert Covington, at the rim, allowing Horford to catch the ball and lay it in to give the Celtics a 99-98 lead.\n\nEmbiid then tried to throw the ball in to Simmons after a Philadelphia timeout, but Horford then stole the ball, and after getting fouled, made a pair of free throws with three seconds left for the final margin.\n\nBelinelli then got one final chance to save the Sixers a second time, but his 30-foot heave – a better look than it seemed like Philadelphia could get, given the Sixers had no timeouts – hit the back of the rim and bounced away, giving the Celtics a wild win and pushing the Sixers to the brink of elimination.\n\nJayson Tatum led all scorers with 24 points for the Celtics, and was plus-24 in 41 minutes. Embiid had 22 points and 19 rebounds but went 10-for-26, with Boston’s plan of single-covering him and sticking to Philadelphia’s perimeter players — none of whom can create their own shot — working like a charm once again.\n\nWhat a turn of events in Philadelphia.\n\nJust when it looked like a catastrophic turnover by J.J. Redick was going to hand Boston a 3-0 lead in this Eastern Conference semifinal, the Sixers inbounded the ball with 1.8 seconds to go to Marco Belinelli, who buried a corner jumper right in front of Philadelphia’s bench to tie the score 89-89 at the end of regulation.\n\nThat wasn’t the end of the strangeness, however. Because it looked initially like Belinelli shot a three-pointer — his foot was clearly over the line — confetti began falling from the ceiling of Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, and people began to rush the floor.\n\nThe start of overtime was delayed because of the confetti still falling from the ceiling, which ESPN’s Cassidy Hubbarth said had to stop completely before the referees can restart the game for health and safety reasons.\n\nEventually, the teams were able to resume this wild game.\n\nJoel Embiid has picked up another body in this game – this time Al Horford, with a huge dunk to tie the game at 83 late in the fourth.\n\nEmbiid may need a couple more of these to pull out a win for the Sixers.\n\nThe Sixers have less than 12 minutes to save their season.\n\nMore stifling defense from the Celtics has tied early in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia has been held under 40 percent from the field, and largely kept out of transition (the Sixers have 16 fast break points, but six of those came in one spurt right at the end of the second quarter). The result has been the Celtics controlling the pace of play throughout, and leaving this game in doubt heading into the final minutes.\n\nDown 2-0 in the series, it’s do-or-die time for the Sixers. Given how this game has played out, whether that will equal success for them is very much in doubt.\n\nThe Sixers made a big run late in the first half to grab control of this game. Why? Because they’ve begun to push the tempo at every opportunity, and good things have followed.\n\nPhiladelphia now leads at halftime 51-48, thanks to that 13-0 run, powered by some stops defensively, and then using those stops to create easy looks offensively, the kinds that Boston’s outstanding halfcourt defense completely thwarted earlier in both the game and the series.\n\nJoel Embiid leads the Sixers with 11 points, eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 16 minutes, having taken 13 shots — five more than any other player on the Sixers, another indication of Brad Stevens being willing to let Embiid shoot while not letting anyone else get going. Ben Simmons, meanwhile, has eight points and five assists on 4-for-6 shooting, and looks far more engaged than he did in Game 2.\n\nBoth Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have three fouls for Boston, which will be something to monitor in the second half. Tatum has 11 points for Celtics, and is their only player in double-figures.\n\nBoston was outscored 26-16 in the 7:12 Tatum sat the bench to end the first half after picking up his third foul. Philadelphia has a 12-3 edge in fast break points, and has scored 10 points on eight Boston turnovers.\n\nLate in the first half, Ben Simmons pushed the ball, up court, hit a trailing Embiid as he came lumbering down the lane behind him, and the 7-foot-2 center rose up and absolutely demolished Baynes, who futilely tried to get in Embiid’s way when it would have been in his best interest to simply get the hell out of the way.\n\nThe result, as the Sixers’ Twitter account happily recounted, was Baynes being posterized in one of many dunks not only in the playoffs, but the entire 2017-18 season.\n\nBig moment for the Celtics, with Jayson Tatum picking up his third foul with more than eight minutes to go in the second quarter.\n\nTatum, who leads Boston with 11 points, has taken on an even bigger role than he did during the regular season in the wake of Kyrie Irving’s season-ending injury.\n\nHis production has helped Boston build a 35-25 lead, as he’s gone 5-for-6 from the field to go with three rebounds and two assists.\n\nBrad Stevens initially left Tatum in the game, but just took him out with seven minutes to go in the first half. Stevens will likely try to keep Tatum on the bench here in hopes of avoiding him picking up a fourth foul before halftime.\n\nThrough nine quarters of Sixers-Celtics, Boston Coach Brad Stevens has clearly stuck to a specific strategy: Let Joel Embiid do his thing, and try to limit everyone else.\n\nEmbiid already has nine shots early in the second quarter, going 4-for-9 with eight points to go with six rebounds and a blocked shot.\n\nBut despite that production, Boston is winning 28-22. Why? Because the rest of the Sixers are 5-for-20, including 2-for-10 from three.\n\nIf the Celtics can limit the “others” for the Sixers to those kinds of numbers, they’ll be content with leaving Embiid one-on-one for the rest of the series. He will put up plenty of production that way, but if no one else does, it doesn’t matter.\n\nAfter Ben Simmons completely flopped in Game 2 of the Sixers’ Eastern Conference semifinal series with the Celtics, all eyes will be on him as the series shifts back to Philadelphia.\n\nThe past two days have been spent dissecting everything Simmons did — or, in reality, didn’t do — in his 31 minutes on the court inside TD Garden. He scored one point while going 0-for-4 from the field with five rebounds, seven assists, five turnovers and was a game-worst minus-23, looking lethargic and wasn’t nearly as aggressive as he normally is.\n\nThis is a huge moment for Simmons. Philadelphia came into this series as the favorite to advance, given Boston’s myriad injuries. Now, after the Celtics took the first two games and Simmons was a no-show on a national stage, he’ll need to return to the form he’s shown throughout the regular season and the first few games of the playoffs, as opposed to his no-show in Game 2.\n\nIf he does, the Sixers can make this a series again, even trailing 2-0. If he doesn’t?

Charlotte got a new birthday portrait this year after all.","title":"Princess Charlotte Kisses Prince Louis In New Photographs by Kate Middleton","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/prince-louis-photo-princess-charlotte","text":"A gentle kiss and a look of complete love: this is birthday girl Princess Charlotte enjoying a quiet moment with her new brother Prince Louis, as seen in one of two new photographs released by Kensington Palace, and taken by Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThese are the first official pictures of the new fifth in line to the throne, born on March 23 in London and revealed to the public hours later in a photo call, but not seen since. The Duchess, who has also not been seen since she gave birth, photographed her newborn son when he was just three days old at the family home at Kensington Palace. Kate, a keen photographer, managed to capture her new born son while he was awake. Looking into the distance the blue-eyed baby looks alert and content as he rests against a cushion on a pink upholstered arm chair.\n\nIn the second picture, released by Kensington Palace Saturday and taken on Princess Charlotte's 3rd birthday, May 2, the little prince is fast asleep and is being cradled by his proud big sister, wearing a blue embroidered cardigan and with her hair pinned back in a ponytail.\n\nWith a shock of dark hair and impressive eyebrows Louis is darker than Prince George when he was born, suggesting he might have inherited his mother's brown hair. His blue eyes, however look more like Charlotte’s, suggesting he will be a perfect combination of both his mother and father. According to one family friend the little prince is a good sleeper although Kate is up every three to four hours for feeds. “George and Charlotte are thrilled to have a new baby. It has been a very exciting time for them all. Charlotte particularly adores Louis, to her he is like a real life doll. She is often by the Moses basket looking down and making sure he is OK. She's very sweet with him and so is George.”\n\nThe fact that the siblings have already bonded may be a relief for Kate, who had been concerned that George and Charlotte might feel jealous with a new arrival taking up her attention. Both the prince and princess received presents from their new brother when he was born, and there were more gifts when the family celebrated Charlotte's birthday with a small tea party last week.\n\nLittle Louis has been busy meeting his grandmother the Queen who helicoptered to Kensington Palace last week, while Prince Charles has also been to see his new grandson. A spokesman for the couple said when the photographs were released, “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte's third birthday.”\n\nIt is unlikely that we will see Prince Louis in public until his christening. Kensington Palace has confirmed that the newborn royal will not be attending the royal wedding.","author":"Katie Nicholl","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T23:18:24.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Vanityfair.com"},"urlToImage":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aee3831310ffe7fb0da4b77/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/t-charlotte-louis.jpg","digest":"ip2aRAg7aBPHiqCdDrrg2A==\n"}

Ellis III pulled no punches while grilling prosecutors working for the special counsel Robert Mueller in federal court Friday.\n\nBut one of the prosecutors, Michael Dreeben, made a telling admission to Ellis near the end that offers an important clue about Mueller's case against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nFriday's hearing was called to weigh Manafort's motion to dismiss one of the two indictments Mueller's office has brought against him. The indictment debated Friday was filed in Virginia and charges Manafort with tax fraud, bank fraud, and failure to report foreign bank accounts related to his lobbying work for the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian interests.\n\nDuring Friday's hearing, Manafort's lawyers said that because the charges in the Virginia case do not relate directly to Mueller's core mandate — investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow — they should be tossed out.\n\nWhen Dreeben countered and said the allegations in the Virginia case were within the scope of Mueller's mandate, Ellis replied, referencing one of the charges: \"The scope covers bank fraud from 2005?\"\n\n\"How does this have anything to do with the campaign?\" Ellis asked, according to The Wall Street Journal. When Dreeben said Manafort had been in contact with individuals in Ukraine who are affiliated with Russia and pro-Russian interests, Ellis accused Dreeben of \"running away from my question.\"\n\nDreeben said Mueller's office takes its \"primary mission\" of investigating Russia's election meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign \"very seriously.\" He added that had prosecutors found evidence of criminal activity that was not necessarily related to Mueller's mandate, they would have referred it to another office.\n\nAccording to The Journal, Ellis then pointed out that Mueller's office had made one such referral to the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York regarding Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer.\n\nDreeben's statement to Ellis raises the possibility that the charges Mueller's office has leveled against Manafort that relate to his Ukraine lobbying work may also be connected to Russian collusion, legal experts said.\n\n\"Dreeben's statement that Manafort was in touch with Russians in Ukraine was responsive to the judge's question,\" said Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago who spent 12 years at the Justice Department.\n\n\"If prosecutors got information that Manafort was talking to relevant Russians — not just a Russian cabbie in Kiev — but relevant Russians, and then uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing related to his Ukraine work as a result, there's your nexus,\" he added.\n\nHis lawyers filed documents in court Monday which said the US government has not provided Manafort with evidence from wiretaps, statements, emails, or text messages to support its claim of a connection between Manafort and Russian individuals or Russian interests.\n\nFriday was not the first time Mueller's team argued that the charges against Manafort are related to the special counsel's primary mandate of investigating whether the campaign colluded with Moscow.\n\nIn court documents filed last month, prosecutors told a federal judge in Washington, DC overseeing a separate criminal case against Manafort that they suspected Manafort of serving as a \"back channel\" between the campaign and Russia during the election.\n\nWhen Manafort's lawyers argued at the time that Mueller's mandate does not cover Manafort's consulting work in Ukraine, Dreeben pushed back and said they were justified in probing Manafort because of his elevated role on the campaign and his \"long-standing ties to Russia-backed politicians\" in Ukraine.\n\n\"Did they provide back channels to Russia?\" Dreeben said. \"Investigators will naturally look at those things.\"\n\nMueller's office said in another April 2 court filing that any investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia \"would naturally cover ties that a former Trump campaign manager had to Russian-associated political operatives, Russian-backed politicians, and Russian oligarchs.\"\n\n\"It would also naturally look into any interactions they may have had before and during the campaign to plumb motives and opportunities to coordinate and to expose possible channels for surreptitious communications,\" it added. \"And prosecutors would naturally follow the money trail from Manafort's Ukrainian consulting activities. Because investigation of those matters was authorized, so was prosecution.\"\n\nProsecutors point to a memo deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein sent to Mueller in August 2017, three months after appointing him special counsel, as evidence that they were authorized to probe Manafort's work in Ukraine.\n\nThe memo outlines the full scope of Mueller's mandate, and though much of the document was redacted before being publicly released, it says Mueller is permitted to investigate at least two threads of criminal allegations related to Manafort:\n\nCramer, the former federal prosecutor, said Saturday that as long as Mueller's team had a \"reasonable purpose\" for looking at Manafort's connections to Russians and Russia-backed individuals, it would be \"perfectly legitimate\" for them to follow any leads they came across as a result.\n\n\"If their initial look at Manafort and his Russia ties was within Mueller's scope — and it seems like that would be the case if the Russians were at all relevant — and they come across Manafort's allegedly illicit activities related to lobbying, not filing taxes, money laundering, and all that, any prosecutor would investigate that,\" Cramer said. \"No question.\"\n\nEllis ordered Mueller's team on Friday to turn over an unredacted copy of Rosenstein's memo to the court under seal within two weeks.\n\nExperts say it's unlikely Ellis will ultimately dismiss the charges against Manafort. But in the event that he does, the US attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia will likely pick up the thread.\n\n\"This is a scathing, detailed indictment against Manafort,\" Cramer said. \"They've got him cold. The only question now is whether Mueller or the US attorney's office will charge him.\"","author":"Sonam Sheth","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-05T22:33:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/596d3710a47cb5d8498b4598-640-320.jpg","digest":"dmuaZjgA5d96cJKw90113w==\n"}

Tyler. Ferguson.\" Strong got eaten by a monster when she reacted: \"From Modern Family?!\"\n\nThen Glover pulled up West's new single, dropped during his ongoing Twitter diatribe about Trump. Aidy Bryant's character was too eager to listen and accidentally hit play before Glover could get his headphones in. The monster didn't strike immediately, but when Bryant couldn't stop wondering about the lyric \"poopity scoop,\" she got eaten.\n\nBeck Bennett was scooped up by the monster when he reacted to the fact that West said slavery was \"a choice.\"\n\nIt ended with Glover in the bunker from the film, listening to the new single and watching West's TMZ appearance where he made the controversial comments about slavery. The monster then got to him, too.\n\nIt's not the first Quiet Place parody.

Active venting of lava and hazardous fumes continues between Mohala and Pomaikai streets. The number of confirmed destroyed homes grew to nine overnight, from five Saturday evening.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense officials said Leilani Estates residents with property between Highway 130 and Maile Street will be allowed to enter the subdivision today to complete evacuation of pets, medicine, and vital documents left behind between the hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m, conditions permitting. Residents should retrieve their items expeditiously so others may go in after them, they said.\n\nNo access is allowed at this time for residents of Lanipuna Gardens due to dangerous volcanic gases.\n\nResidents will be required to provide identification and proof of residency in the Leilani subdivision.\n\nLeilani residents entering must be on the alert for elevated levels of Sulfur Dioxide, wildfire, and volcanic eruption, they said.\n\nThe lava outbreaks in Leilani Estates remained active overnight with a new fissure emerging and lava fountains as high as 230 feet, according to Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nHVO scientists said early today that the latest opening appeared near fissures No. 2 and 7, the latter of which had stopped erupting by mid-afternoon Saturday.\n\n“Early this morning, new ground cracks were reported on Highway 130, but no hear or escaping steam was subsequently observed,” HVO said.\n\nThey added that seismic activity and ground deformation indicates that the accumulation of magma along the Kilauea’s East Rift Zone continues.\n\nMandatory evacuations remain in effect for residents of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens in lower Puna on the Big Island.\n\nHundreds of aftershocks from Friday afternoon’s magnitude-6.9 quake have been felt over the weekend, including several above magnitude 4.0.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists confirmed this evening that no new lava outbreaks have emerged beyond the eight fissures that have already been identified in Leilani Estates in lower Puna.\n\nBut Hawaii County Civil Defense officials caution that the fissures have already destroyed five homes and continue to emit hazardous fumes in the subdivision.\n\nThey said that Hawaii Fire Department reports “extremely dangerous air quality conditions due to high levels of sulfur dioxide gas in the evacuation area” and that the high levels of sulfur dioxide are a threat to anyone exposed.\n\nThe subdivisions of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens remain under evacuation orders.\n\n“The area continues to be unstable with volcanic venting and related hazards of earthquake and poisonous gases ongoing. Please heed all advisories,” county officials said tonight.\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park will remain closed tonight, but officials said that if volcanic and seismic activity remain at current levels within the park, it could partially reopen Sunday afternoon.\n\n“Park staff have been busy assessing trails, roads and buildings in the front country areas of the park today, and thus far, minimal damage has been reported,” they said this evening.\n\nThe park abruptly closed and was evacuated Friday afternoon after a magnitude-6.9 quake, centered in Leilani Estates, shook the area. It was the largest earthquake in Hawaii since 1975.\n\nHawaii Electric Light Co. officials, meanwhile, warned Leilani Estates residents to be careful because of damaged electrical equipment in the lava-inundation areas.\n\n“Utility equipment has been damaged by lava in the Leilani Estates subdivision,” said company spokeswoman Rhea Lee-Moku. “Company employees are unable to enter restricted areas to restore power or confirm problems with electrical service. Everyone should treat lines, transformers, and other utility equipment as energized even if the equipment is on the ground.”\n\nThe company urged the public to stay away from downed or low hanging power lines.\n\nHawaii County officials say the eight lava fissures in Leilani Estates in lower Puna “went quiet” for now after destroying at least five homes since Thursday evening.\n\nTalmadge Magno, administrator of Hawaii County Civil Defense, said this afternoon that the eight separate fissures now appear connected by the lava that flowed out of them. He said the seismic activity and the lava flows have “died down (but) we are pretty sure we are not done.”\n\nMagno said that county officials are looking at the possibility of letting some subdivision residents to temporarily return, perhaps as soon as Sunday, to “take care of their animals and get important documents.” However, he stressed, county officials would still would not going to let them stay. “We want them to come out,” he said.\n\nHe said that perhaps half of the evacuees may be allowed to make the temporary return, but officials are still planning how to do it safely. They want to set up a process to vet the residents to make sure people who do not belong in the subdivision are allowed in, he said.\n\nWil Okabe, Hawaii County managing director, said one of the biggest concerns is the level of dangerous sulfur dioxide gases from the lava. He said the biggest priority is the safety of the residents and county officials will have to consider sulfur dioxide levels and wind direction before letting residents to temporarily return.\n\nOkabe also said there has been outpouring of support and offers to help. He said he received a call from the agent of Major League Baseball player and Hilo native Kolten Wong who, along with his St. Louis Cardinals teammates, want to help the Big Island community.\n\nLava vents from Kilauea volcano have destroyed five homes in Leilani Estates, Hawaii County officials said this afternoon.\n\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory officials said early this afternoon that the ongoing “eruptive activity is increasing and expected to continue.”\n\nCounty officials said eight active lava vents have been confirmed on Makamae, Kaupili, Mohala, Kahukai streets and Pohoiki Road, with two new vents near Makamae and Leilani streets, and on Kahukai Street. There was no lava activity at the now-shut Puna Geothermal Venture as of midday, they said.\n\nHawaiian Electric Light Co., meanwhile, said power has been interrupted to Leilani Estates due to lava affecting power lines. Company crews are standing by and monitoring the situation, officials said.\n\nStaff at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory confirm the current Kilauea eruption continues in the Leilani Estates subdivision in Puna, with multiple vents located on Makamae St., Kaupili St., Mohala St., Kahukai St. and Pohoiki Rd.\n\nIn addition, two new fissures have opened in the area. The first appeared overnight at Leilani Avenue and Kahukai St. At 10 a.m. Saturday, HVO officials reported a second vent had been spotted earlier this morning in the area of Makamae and Kahukai streets.\n\nAccording to a HVO spokesperson, there are now eight locations in Leilani Estates where lava is being monitored by staff.\n\nThe pool at the Pahoa Community Aquatic Center, 15-2910 Puna Rd., is closed for public swimming until further notice.\n\nShower and restroom facilities will remain open for residents to use for personal hygeine.\n\nAmerican Red Cross shelters at the Pahoa Community Center, 15-3022 Kauhale St., and the Keeau Community Center, 16-186 Pili Mua St., remain open today for Puna residents displaced by the current Kilauea volcano eruption.\n\nAs of midnight, 157 people were at the Pahoa Community Center, with another 27 people at the Keeau shelter. Another 40 to 50 residents remained in their cars overnight at the Keeau Community Center parking lot.\n\nVisit the Red Cross website for more information on what to put in an emergency kit.\n\nAn evacuation notice remains in effect for all residents of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, with various government agencies and the National Guard assisting those still in the area. The Pahoa Community Center and the Keaau Community Center are currently open to shelter evacuees.\n\nHawaii County Dept. of Water Supply officials say an emergency water restriction remains in place for Leilani Estates, Nanawale Estates, Kapoho and Lanipuna Gardens. Water should be used for health and safety needs only.\n\nPAHOA, Hawaii \u003e\u003e In the span of less than 24 hours, Hawaii island shook from the state’s strongest earthquake since 1975, evacuated roughly 1,800 people from lower Puna, and witnessed six new Kilauea volcano lava fissures burn into the small rural community of Leilani Estates.\n\nThe volcano, which had been threatening a new lava outbreak for days, opened up the first fissure shortly before 5 p.m. Thursday in the eastern end of the subdivision. The first outbreak was short-lived, lasting only a few hours and causing no known structure damage.\n\nBut by Friday afternoon there were at least six active fissures in the community, destroying a home and two other buildings, sending dangerous gas into the air, and forcing the evacuation of the entire subdivision.\n\nFurther, the ground shook steadily throughout the last two days, with hundreds of tremors of magnitude 2.5 or higher, with the strongest quake measuring magnitude 6.9 at 12:32 p.m. and centered in Leilani Estates, followed by countless aftershocks. The largest quake knocked out power to thousands, caused slight sea-level fluctuations and scared residents throughout the islands. It did not generate a tsunami.\n\n“Things started shaking side to side. That was huge, the longest I ever felt,” said Hilo resident Bobbie Stivers-Apiki.\n\nHilo Hawaiian Hotel bellman Alan Shinkai said he was in the elevator during the quake. “I wanted to reach the ground as fast as possible,” he said.\n\nThe seismic and volcanic hyperactivity led to numerous closures and disruptions across the Big Island.\n\n\u003e\u003e All residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens Subdivisions are required to evacuate.\n\n\u003e\u003e The American Red Cross opened two shelters at the Pahoa and Keaau community centers. The Pahoa center had 200 residents by this afternoon while the Keaau center had 2 residents.\n\n\u003e\u003e The Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was closed in the afternoon “for the safety of our visitors and employees” after the violent shaking from the 12:32 p.m. quake. Park officials evacuated 2,600 visitors, relocated guests at Volcano House hotel and Kilauea Military Camp, and sent home all non-emergency park employees. “Safety is our main priority at Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park, and it is currently not safe to be here,” said Park Superintendent Cindy Orlando. “We will monitor the situation closely, and reopen when it is safe to do so.”\n\nPark officials said the quake triggered rock slides on trails, crater walls, and along Chain of Craters Road, while an earlier magnitude-5.4 quake caused a coastal cliff to collapse into the ocean near the Holei Sea Arch. The quake also caused narrow fissures in the ground at an overlook near Jaggar Museum, and rock falls into the lava lake within Halemaumau Crater, sending up dark clouds of ash.\n\n\u003e\u003eThe largest quake cut power to 14,400 Hawaii Electric Light Co. customers. By 2:25 p.m., service had been restored to all customers, the company reported.\n\n\u003e\u003e Kua O Ka La Charter School, Hawaii Academy of Arts and Science, Keonepoko Elementary and Pahoa High, Intermediate, and Elementary were closed today.\n\n\u003e\u003e About 70 members of the Hawaii National Guard were deployed to the island to help with evacuation and other efforts. Those citizen-soldiers include six from the Guard’s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team who will help the county with air quality tests. Hawaii National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Charles Anthony said the team will bring equipment to help detect sulfur dioxide in Puna and provide air samples to the county.\n\nHawaii Fire Department reports extremely high levels of dangerous sulfur dioxide gas detected in the evacuation area. Elderly, young, and people with respiratory issues need to comply with the mandatory evacuation order and leave the area.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions for the area above lower Puna until 11:59 p.m. Monday, due to the volcanic activity. The restrictions cover a five-nautical-miles radius of Pahoa, from the surface up to 3,000 feet above sea level. No pilots may operate an aircraft — including drones — in the area. Relief aircraft operations under the direction of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency are authorized in the airspace.\n\n\u003e\u003e The county Department of Water Supply issued an emergency water restriction for Leilani Estates, Nanawale Estates, Kapoho and Lanipuna Gardens, telling all water customers to immediately restrict water use to health and safety needs only.\n\n\u003e\u003e On Thursday, Puna Geothermal Venture operations have shut down indefinitely until further notice. County officials said the facility is secure.\n\nAll the volcanic activity in Puna — and its dramatic images — have grabbed the attention of national and international media, prompting the Hawaii Tourism Authority to remind the traveling public that most of the action is in a remote, sparsely populated area, and that most of the state is unaffected by earthquakes and molten lava.\n\nGeorge D. Szigeti, HTA’s president and chief executive, reassured travelers that flights haven’t been affected by the Kilauea volcano and the “area where lava is coming to the surface is very far from resort areas throughout the Hawaiian Islands where visitor accommodations are located.”\n\nGov. David Ige said in a statement, “We have heard from people around the world concerned about Hawaii’s welfare and want to reassure everyone that this is limited to a remote region on the slopes of Kilauea volcano. Everywhere else in the Hawaiian islands is not affected.”\n\nStill, the quakes and flowing lava has unnerved many on the Big Isle.\n\nState Sen. Russell Ruderman, of Keaau, said items were falling off the shelf while he was at Island Naturals, his Hilo natural food store, when the magnitude-6.9 quake struck.\n\n“This last one was scary,” he said, adding that he lived in San Francisco for 10 years and experienced some there. “It starts rocking and keeps on going. It’s very frightening. We’re rattled.”\n\nEvacuated Puna residents Henry and Stella Caleo, 64, said they don’t know if their home would still be standing.\n\n“We don’t know anything,” Stella Caleo said. “We don’t know if we’re going to lose our house. We know nothing.”\n\nThe uncertainty extends to what Kilauea volcano will do next.\n\nLate this afternoon, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials said that active volcanic vents continue on Makamae, Kaupili and Mohala streets, and near the intersection of Leilani Avenue and Kahukai Road.\n\nThey warn of “extremely dangerous conditions” due to sulfur dioxide in the evacuation area. “The high levels detected are an immediate threat to life for all who become exposed. First responders may not be able to come to the aid of residents who refuse to evacuate,” they said.\n\nThey also caution that more lava vents and more powerful earthquakes are possible in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nFor the latest information from Hawaii County, visit hawaiicounty.gov/active-alerts.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T18:48:51.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Staradvertiser.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/web1_20180505_WEB_LavaVent-2.jpg","digest":"EvNBDD5RPg9E01FZlXyL+w==\n"}

That bests the 12 days it took Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Infinity War becomes the 34th movie to cross $1 billion at the global box office, not accounting for inflation. The Disney empire lays claim to half of those titles with 17.\n\nForce Awakens is the record holder for biggest second weekend ($149.2 million) in North America, while Infinity War nudged aside Black Panther ($111.7 million). Jurassic World ($106.6 million) and The Avengers ($103.1 million) follow. They are the only five films to earn north of $100 million in their sophomore sessions.\n\nInfinity War fell 56 percent domestically, a respectable decline for a superhero tentpole. Marvel's Black Panther was an exception in falling just 45 percent. The first Avengers fell 50 percent, while Avengers: Age of Ultron slipped 59 percent and Captain America: Civil War declined 60 percent.\n\nThe other major Hollywood studios continued to sit on the sidelines because of Infinity War, which has resulted in 2018 domestic revenue running ahead of last year by more than 5 percent.\n\nInstead, a trio of smaller films debuted, led by MGM and Lionsgate's remake of Overboard. The romantic comedy, starring popular Mexican actor Eugenio Derbez and Anna Faris, grossed$14.8 million from 1,623 theaters to come in No. 2. It is the biggest opening to date for Lionsgate's Pantelion Films, which took advantage of the Cinco de Mayo holiday in plugging the movie, which cost in the mid-teens to produce.\n\nThe marketing campaign for Overboard, which earned an A- CinemaScore from audiences, included two distinctly different trailers, including one in Spanish (200 prints of the film were also dubbed in Spanish). Hispanics made up a hefty 42 percent of ticket buyers.\n\nLast year, Derbez's How to Be a Latin Lover opened to $12.3 million on its way to a domestic total of $32.1 million. His credits also include Instructions Not Included (2013), the top-grossing Spanish-language film of all time in the U.S. ($44.5 million). The remake sees the roles played by Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell in the original film swapped, with Derbez playing a spoiled playboy and Faris as a single mom hired to clean his yacht.\n\n\"We've been pitched remaking Overboard several times, but this take felt fresh and original because of the gender flip,\" says MGM Motion Picture Group president Jonathan Glickman.\n\nParamount's hit horror film A Quiet Place came in No. 3 in its fifth weekend with $7.6 million for a domestic total of $159.9 million. Globally, the movie screamed past the $250 million mark to finish Sunday with $255.3 million in worldwide ticket sales.\n\nSTX's Amy Schumer comedy I Feel Pretty placed No. 4 with $4.9 million for a tepid domestic tally of $37.8 million. It has earned $46.8 million worldwide to date. Dwayne Johnson's Rampage, from Warner Bros., rounded out the top five with $4.6 million to finish Sunday with a global total of $377.9 million, including $84.8 million domestically and $293.1 million overseas.\n\nFocus Features' new dramedy Tully, reuniting Charlize Theron with her Young Adult director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody, came in No. 7 with $3.2 million from 1,353 cinemas. Tully stars Theron as a mother of three, including a newborn, who forms a unique bond with a night nanny (Mackenzie Davis) gifted by her rich brother (Mark Duplass). The R-rated pic has sparked controversy in some quarters for its depiction of postpartum depression.\n\nThe weekend's third new nationwide offering was Bad Samaritan, directed by Dean Devlin and marking the first wide release from Devlin's distribution venture, Electric Entertainment. The film, starring David Tennant as a low-level hustler caught up in a nefarious kidnapping plot, opened to a forgettable $1.8 million from 2,007 locations.\n\nNew titles at the specialty box office include Magnolia and Participant Media's RBG, a documentary about U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The film placed No. 16 with $560,000 from 34 theaters for a strong per-screen average of $16,471.","author":"Pamela McClintock","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T18:06:22.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Hollywoodreporter.com"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/04/infinitywar5aa86b6fc55c4_-_h_2018.jpg","digest":"+Okb4kTo5HCvQLfiDdDuYQ==\n"}

She was summoned to the White House on Friday for a meeting on her history in the CIA’s controversial interrogation program — which employed techniques such as waterboarding that are widely seen as torture — and signaled that she was going to withdraw her nomination. She then returned to CIA headquarters, the officials said.\n\nTaken aback at her stance, senior White House aides, including legislative affairs head Marc Short and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, rushed to Langley, Va., to meet with Haspel at her office late Friday afternoon. Discussions stretched several hours, officials said, and the White House was not entirely sure she would stick with her nomination until Saturday afternoon, according to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nTrump learned of the drama Friday, calling officials from his trip to Dallas. He decided to push for Haspel to remain as the nominee after initially signaling he would support whatever decision was taken, administration officials said.\n\n[Gina Haspel and the history of CIA women]\n\nHaspel, who serves as the CIA’s deputy director and has spent 33 years in the agency, most of it undercover, faces some opposition in Congress because of her connection to the interrogation program, which was set up after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nIn late 2002, Haspel oversaw a secret CIA detention facility in Thailand, where one al-Qaeda suspect was waterboarded. Another detainee also was waterboarded before Haspel’s arrival.\n\nThree years later, Haspel was involved in the CIA’s destruction of nearly 100 videotapes that recorded the men’s interrogations, touching off an investigation by a special prosecutor who ultimately decided not to bring charges against those involved.\n\n“There has been a fascinating phenomenon over the last few weeks. Those who know the true Gina Haspel — who worked with her, who served with her, who helped her confront terrorism, Russia and countless other threats to our nation — they almost uniformly support her,” said Ryan Trapani, a CIA spokesman. “That is true for people who disagree about nearly everything else. There is a reason for that. When the American people finally have a chance to see the true Gina Haspel on Wednesday, they will understand why she is so admired and why she is and will be a great leader for this agency.”\n\nSanders declined to comment on Haspel’s offer to withdraw or internal White House discussions, but she stressed that Haspel is a dedicated public servant qualified for the role and that she has the full support of the president.\n\n“She is the best of the best,” Sanders said of Haspel, describing her as a “patriot.”\n\nAn administration official said the nomination remains on track. “There is a hearing prep session today, courtesy calls with senators Monday and Tuesday, and classified materials will be delivered to Senate security so senators can read the real record instead of relying on gossip and unfounded smears,” the official said.\n\nBut Haspel’s nomination to become the first woman to lead the CIA came close to being scuttled Friday ahead of any hearings — and largely at her own hand, the U.S. officials said. The problem came to a head Friday afternoon when she was summoned to the White House for some urgent questions, particularly on her role in the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques.\n\nShe had been in a meeting with her staff at CIA headquarters in Langley, fielding mock questions to prepare for her confirmation hearing, when the summons arrived.\n\nSome White House officials were concerned by material being raised in questions from Congress, information they were just learning about, according to the U.S. officials. Those officials said the material was not revelations that have been unearthed in recent months, but the White House wanted to hear Haspel’s explanation of it.\n\nSome records from the interrogation program, including documents that haven’t been made public, show that Haspel was an enthusiastic supporter of what the CIA was doing, according to officials familiar with the matter. But others have disputed any characterization of Haspel as some kind of cheerleader of the harsh treatment of detainees and noted that the program was authorized by the president, deemed legal by administration lawyers and briefed to members of Congress.\n\nHaspel’s chances of winning Senate confirmation are considered uncertain, in part because of the 51-to-49 party split and the prolonged absence of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is undergoing treatment for a rare form of brain cancer. Members of Congress, particularly Democrats, have been resistant to Haspel’s nomination without more information about her role in the program. The nomination has sparked trepidation inside the White House, with some Trump advisers telling the president in recent weeks she was unlikely to be confirmed.\n\nLawmakers had been pushing last month for more access to a handful of cables and other CIA material that might shed more light on Haspel’s work. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the more material she reads about Haspel’s role in the interrogation program, including the destruction of tapes, the more unsettled she has become.\n\nLast month, the CIA declassified an internal disciplinary review that “found no fault with the performance” of Haspel in the destruction of the videotapes. Haspel drafted a cable approving the destruction that her boss ultimately sent to field officers, who fed the tapes into a shredding machine. But she believed that he would first get the approval of senior CIA leaders before sending it, according to people with knowledge of the episode.\n\nThe release of the disciplinary review may persuade some lawmakers who had been undecided to support Haspel, said congressional officials tracking the nomination process.\n\nAmid the questioning in the West Wing on Friday afternoon, Haspel told White House aides she did not want her nomination to harm the CIA. She also feared unfair attacks on her own reputation, saying that she didn’t want to be “the next Ronny Jackson,” one official said. Jackson, Trump’s White House doctor, withdrew his nomination to become Veterans Affairs secretary following questions regarding alleged misconduct earlier in his career.\n\nShort, the White House legislative affairs director, told Haspel she could still be confirmed despite the information that had recently come to attention of the White House — and the administration expected some Democrats to support her, officials said.\n\nBy Saturday, the officials said, Haspel had agreed to continue with her nomination.\n\nSanders issued a tweet in support of Haspel and rebuking her detractors on Capitol Hill late Saturday afternoon.\n\n“There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel,” she tweeted. “Any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T17:37:20.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qoY7_z1VAIfqPiYoIbaL1ZkAto4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4HZAOCRJYI6RJKRLNSIVPRJ54.jpg","digest":"RkQVm79kZo8HAg+Ty7kRQA==\n"}

Giuliani: Mueller may be going after Manafort because he thinks he will 'flip faster' MORE’s decision on whether to withdraw nears.\n\n\n\nFew observers expect that Trump will stay in the deal after next week’s deadline on May 12. But Trump has teased a possible twist, saying “nobody knows what I’m going to do on the 12th.”\n\n\n\nVoices, both at home and abroad, are making pitches in hopes of swaying Trump to their side.\n\n\n\nBut Trump appears intent on withdrawing — barring a last-minute follow-up deal with the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The president laid out some pretty clear stakes in ground for what he wanted from the Europeans. I think it’s just that easy,” said James Carafano, a defense policy expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on the Trump transition. “He’s already across the Rubicon. He’s decided the deal’s not working, and a fix that doesn’t fix anything is not acceptable.”The nuclear accord, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, gives Tehran billions of dollars of sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. The United States, Iran, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and the European Union signed the agreement.Trump has three grievances with the deal. They include sunsets for several provisions, restrictions on which military sites inspectors can demand to see and the deal’s failure to cover other Iranian activities like its ballistic missile program or support for terrorist groups.\n\nIn January, Trump announced he would continue waiving sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal, but warned it would be the last time he does so unless the European signatories agree to a second deal that covers those three areas.\n\n\n\nFailing to waive the sanctions on May 12 would essentially mean the United States has withdrawn from the agreement. As the deadline approaches, no deal with the Europeans appears imminent.\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to persuade Trump to stay in the deal in visits to Washington two weeks ago. The visit from Macron, who has developed a friendly rapport with Trump, was seen in particular by supporters of the deal as the best chance to save it.\n\n\n\nBut Macron has sounded pessimistic about the deal’s fate since his meeting with Trump.\n\n\n\n“My view — I don’t know what your president will decide — is that he will get rid of this deal on his own for domestic reasons,” Macron told reporters at the end of his visit to Washington.\n\n\n\nFollowing Macron and Merkel's visits, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a dramatic presentation this week that appeared aimed at convincing Trump to scrap the nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nNetanyahu’s speech was delivered in English in front of a screen on which he displayed visuals and talking points, including the words “Iran lied” in massive black letters. He presented what he said was conclusive evidence that Iran lied about its desire to obtain a nuclear weapon in the early 2000s, then hid the evidence so it has the ability to one day restart the program.\n\n\n\n“This is a terrible deal. It should never have been concluded, and in a few days time, President Trump will decide, will make his decision on what to do with the nuclear deal,” Netanyahu said. “I’m sure he’ll do the right thing. The right thing for the United States, the right thing for Israel and the right thing for the peace of the world.”\n\n\n\nMany brushed off Netanyahu’s speech as rehashing old information, but it appears to have hit a nerve with Trump.\n\n\n\n“I'm not telling you what I'm doing, but a lot of people think they know,” Trump said after Netanyahu’s speech. \"That doesn't mean I wouldn’t negotiate a new agreement. We’ll see what happens, but I think if anything what’s happening today and what’s happened over the last little while and what we’ve learned has really shown that I’ve been 100 percent right.”\n\n\n\nStill, those who support fixing the deal are hopeful that Netanyahu’s speech will convince Europe they need to make a concrete agreement with Trump.\n\n\n\n“There is a possibility for this data to be used for withdrawal, but you could also really pressure the Europeans to meet us more than halfway,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\n\nTaleblu thinks Netanyahu made a case to pressure Europe into agreeing to strong language on the military inspections issue.\n\n\n\n“I think there’s a more-than-stringent case to go to the Europeans and say, ‘Meet us more than halfway, and this is why [Iran] can’t just give us a promissory note on military inspections,’ ” he said.\n\n\n\nCarafano, at Heritage, said he was unsure of how Netanyahu’s play would affect the Europeans. Either way, though, Carafano said it’s an advantage for the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n“This is fine because it really ramps up pressure on the Europeans, and if that doesn’t work, it reminds people why we’re walking away from the deal,” he said, describing Trump’s thinking.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Obama administration officials have been out in force defending the agreement they negotiated. Former Secretary of State John Kerry John Forbes KerryDem presidential hopefuls flock to Trump country Kerry making quiet play to save Iran deal with foreign leaders: report Trump is right to blast the disastrous Iran Deal MORE tweeted in support of the deal after Netanyahu’s speech, while former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz Ernest Jeffrey MonizKerry making quiet play to save Iran deal with foreign leaders: report Overnight Energy: Pruitt defends first-class travel | Watchdog says contractor charged Energy Department for spas, lobbying | Experts see eased EPA enforcement under Trump Obama energy secretary named to utility giant’s board MORE talked on CNN about how it would be “foolish” to withdraw.\n\n\n\nThree Obama administration officials also held a conference call with reporters Friday to discuss the consequences of not renewing the sanctions waivers, arguing the United States will also be abrogating its commitment to allies that signed the deal and give Iran an excuse to restart its nuclear program.\n\n“The full effect of the move to not renew the waivers could take months to come completely into focus, given how the sanctions are structured, given that there’s actually multiple rounds of waivers, of waiver nonrenewals the president will have to go through,” Jake Sullivan, a former deputy assistant to former President Obama, said on the call. “But what will be immediately obvious after May 12 is that President Trump is throwing the United States and the Iran deal into a nuclear crisis essentially to cater to his political base, and neither the president nor his administration appear to have any strategy or plan for what comes next.”","author":"Rebecca Kheel","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T16:05:05.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-hill","name":"The Hill"},"urlToImage":"http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_iran_050418getty.jpg","digest":"2dSnU/LMQJnc8/iepvYDsA==\n"}

Giuliani on Sunday defended the payment an attorney for President Trump made in 2016 to an adult-film star who had alleged a relationship with Trump, and said it was possible that that lawyer may have paid off other women as well.\n\nThe comment from Giuliani, the former New York mayor who recently joined Trump’s legal team, comes amid an ongoing furor over a string of assertions he has made regarding the 2016 payment to Stormy Daniels, why it was made and how much the president knew about it.\n\nWhen asked during an interview on ABC News’s “This Week” whether Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, had made payments to other women, Giuliani said he did not know of any but acknowledged that this could have happened.\n\n“I have no knowledge of that,” Giuliani said. “But I would think if it was necessary, yes.”\n\nGiuliani has given a string of interviews and made a series of public comments in recent days regarding the $130,000 that Cohen gave to Daniels — who had spoken with journalists about her claims of an affair with Trump years earlier — just days before Trump won the presidency in 2016.\n\nHe revealed last week that Trump had reimbursed Cohen, a startling announcement that stood in direct contrast to the president’s own public claims weeks earlier. After making other remarks to the media — including seemingly connecting the payment to the presidential election — Giuliani then released a cautiously worded statement Friday trying to clean up his comments.\n\n[Giuliani tries to clarify comments on Trump’s reimbursement of payment to porn star Stormy Daniels]\n\nDuring the interview on “This Week,” during which he also said Trump would not have to comply with a subpoena from the special counsel investigation, Giuliani dismissed the president’s comments about the Daniels payment to reporters aboard Air Force One in early April. The president had said he did not know about Cohen’s payment or where Cohen got the money.\n\n“The reality is, those are not facts that worry me as a lawyer … those don’t amount to anything, what’s said to the press,” Giuliani said. “That’s political.”\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, said Sunday that Trump’s comments on Air Force One were him saying “he didn’t know when the payment occurred.”\n\n“I’m going to relay to you what the president has told me, which is the best I can do,” Conway said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He didn’t know it at the time that the payment occurred.”\n\nConway said she has “no reason” not to believe Trump’s comments denying the affair, and she denied that the White House has a problem with credibility. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker has been tracking Trump’s false or misleading public claims in office, and so far, it has found more than 3,000 such comments — an average of 6.5 claims per day.\n\n[Trump and his attorney didn’t tell the truth, if Giuliani is right. Will that change anything?]\n\nConway also said she did not know of any other payments made to women during the campaign that were similar to the Daniels transaction, saying “they didn’t cross my desk as campaign manager.”\n\nIn his interview, Giuliani again sought to argue that the payment was not a campaign contribution, saying it was “entirely reimbursed out of personal funds.” Experts have said that even if it was not made with campaign money, the timing of it raises questions, as does the fact that it was never revealed in financial disclosure forms.\n\nGiuliani said he did not know the answers to numerous questions, including when Trump learned that Daniels would take money to remain quiet, whether Trump knew about it after the campaign and precisely when Trump found out about the payment.\n\n[Giuliani says Trump doesn’t have to comply with a Mueller subpoena and could invoke the Fifth Amendment]\n\nHe said the money was paid “to settle a personal issue that would be embarrassing” to Trump and his wife, and also argued that the amount of money made it seem like more of “a nuisance payment” than anything else.\n\n“I never thought $130,000 — I know this sounds funny to people there at home,” he said. “I never thought $130,000 was a real payment; it’s a nuisance payment. When I settle this, when it was real or a real possibility, it’s a couple million dollars, not $130,000.”\n\nGiuliani said that Cohen is no longer Trump’s personal attorney, adding that that would be a conflict. He also said that the possibility of pardoning Cohen — who is facing scrutiny from federal investigators exploring whether he committed bank fraud and wire fraud — has not been raised.\n\n“Michael’s lawyers all know that that obviously is not on the table,” Giuliani said. “That’s not a decision to be made now; there’s no reason to pardon anybody now.”\n\n[Analysts: Giuliani’s media blitz gives investigators new leads, new evidence]\n\nGiuliani also spoke critically of Daniels, who made an appearance on “Saturday Night Live” the previous night, something he brought up three times during the interview. He said Daniels “was opportunistic” in seeking money before the election and suggested that she was just seeking “fame and fortune,” adding: “She’s become rich as a result of this. The $130,000 doesn’t mean anything.\n\n“I do think it’s suspect that she waits until the very last minute with regard to the campaign, and where you could get the maximum personal damage against the president.”\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, had told her story to multiple journalists over the years, including reporters from Slate and In Touch magazine, before signing the confidentiality agreement and a statement denying the affair. Daniels said she is being paid more nowadays for doing the same things she was already doing, but she pushed back against the notion that she was happy to be receiving so much notoriety because of Trump.\n\n“This isn’t what I want to be known for,” Daniels said on “The View” last month. She said she has had to hire bodyguards, describing the situation as “overwhelming and intimidating and downright scary a lot of the times.”\n\nMichael Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, appeared on “This Week” after Giuliani and called the former mayor’s comments “a train wreck.”\n\n“This guy’s all over the map over the last 72 hours on some very simple facts that should be very straightforward,” Avenatti said. “I think it is obvious … to the American people that this is a coverup, that they are making it up as they go along, they don’t know what to say because they’ve lost track of the truth.”\n\nLegal experts have said Giuliani’s remarks in recent days may have exposed Trump to potential legal risks and could have compromised his attorney-client privilege with the president.\n\nIn his comments, Giuliani appeared to be trying to play down the payment, and he repeatedly argued that it did not amount to a campaign finance violation. A watchdog group filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department, alleging that the Daniels payment violated campaign finance laws.\n\nFederal judge says special counsel wants Manafort to ‘sing’ about Trump","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T15:37:55.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XATzpEVKmJwE8ZC_D9C406QJEW0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HEWKMWFFVI3D5AKDP5PPNWUH6I.jpg","digest":"pNfKhSChwOKnnNrBelWkIA==\n"}

Korea: Trump ruining good mood ahead of summit","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/06/north-korea-us-ruining-good-mood-summit/584528002/","text":"North Korea warned the United States on Sunday not to misread peace overtures as a sign of weakness, accusing the Trump administration of deliberately provoking Pyongyang with tough talk and a show of military strength.\n\n\"It would not be conducive to addressing the issue if the U.S. miscalculates the peace-loving intention of the DPRK (North Korea) as a sign of 'weakness' and continues to pursue its pressure and military threats,\" a spokesman for the North Korean foreign ministry told the state-run Korean Central News Agency.\n\nThe criticism came weeks before a much-anticipated summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It also came after last month's historic meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nAt that meeting, Kim pledged to work toward denuclearizing the peninsula and to dismantle his nuclear missile testing site. He also agreed to move his nation's clocks forward by 30 minutes to correspond to South Korea's time zone, an action that took place Saturday.\n\nDespite the gains, the North Korean spokesman on Sunday accused the Trump administration of misleading the public by claiming Pyongyang is motivated by fear of U.S. military strength and concerns about aggressive economic sanctions put in place because of the North's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nMovement of U.S. military assets into the region and talk of human rights violations also have hurt the process, the spokesman said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency suggested the military assets include eight U.S. F-22 stealth fighter jets recently sent to participate in the joint annual South Korea-U.S. air training.\n\n\"This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one,\" the spokesman said.\n\nMore: North Korea adjusts time zone to match South Korea in latest step toward unity\n\nMore: Giuliani backtracks on imminent release of Americans by North Korea\n\nA thaw in relations between the two nations in recent weeks drew international optimism that a deal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula could be struck.\n\nThe relative warmth between the two leaders even prompted talk that three Americans held by North Korea might soon be released. Last week, Trump tweeted that the Obama administration had \"long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!\"\n\nEven amid the excitement, many experts had warned that much work remained before real diplomatic progress could take shape.\n\nJay Lefkowitz, who served as President George W. Bush's special envoy on human rights in North Korea, acknowledged that the release of the prisoners could be seen as a \"confidence-building measure\" heading into the summit.\n\n\"That said, with hundreds of thousands of political prisoners held in brutal prison camps across North Korea, it’s much too early to have any confidence that the upcoming talks will lead to a radical transformation in North Korea or to a genuine warming of its relations with the United States,\" Lefkowitz told USA TODAY.\n\nStill, Moon and Kim have agreed to work on a plan to formally end the Korean War that was halted by a temporary armistice in 1953. Kim has said a formal end to the hostilities, along with a pledge from the U.S. not to attack his nation, would essentially eliminate Pyongyang's need for a nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"The U.S. is misleading the public opinion, arguing as if the DPRK's clarification of its intention for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula ... is the result of so-called sanctions and pressure,\" the spokesman said Sunday.","author":"John Bacon","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T15:04:19.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb4db209b9040ce349f30b06caae28d6425dce07/c=0-199-3000-1894\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636607822190454455-AFP-AFP-VK1ZE-96307421.JPG","digest":"9PjR0dHh0f2QUFT00yFUhA==\n"}

A third person -- a woman -- was slightly injured by broken glass, authorities said.\n\nThe two men suffered injuries that are not life-threatening, and are in stable condition.\n\nA search of Harbour's home revealed a \"hate-filled\" document applauding Cruz, who massacred 17 people at a high School in Florida in February. \"He called Nikolas Cruz a 'hero' and said Cruz gave him 'courage and confidence,' \" Couch said.

He was detained by police shortly after arriving in Moscow's Pushkinskaya Square, with dramatic images showing the protest leader being carried through the crowds by police.\n\nNavalny said in a tweet that he was released shortly after midnight on Sunday, after police \"registered two protocols against me: organization of a rally and resistance of the police.\"\n\nHis release comes ahead of Putin's inauguration as president Monday after winning re-election in March.\n\nIt will be Putin's fourth term as president, delivering him six more years as leader, and ultimately seeing him in power for 24 years. It also makes him Russia's longest-serving leader after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's 29-year rule.\n\nNavalny is Russia's best-known opposition leader, and was barred from running in the presidential elections after a 2017 criminal conviction for embezzlement. Critics say the case against the 41-year-old was politically motivated to keep him off the ballot. Police detained about 300 people at the \"unauthorized rally,\" according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. Protesters chanted \"shame,\" \"Putin is a thief\" and \"we're fed up\" as they marched through Moscow, some carrying placards or Russian flags. A number of pro-Putin supporters also turned up at the protest, their chants drowning out those for Navalny. Navalny was detained for \"staging an unsanctioned public event,\" TASS reported. Russian authorities demand that applications be filed and the timing and location approved for any rallies, protests or public events. In this case, city officials had not authorized the protest in Pushkinskaya Square. The Navalny campaign had been offered another location away from the city center, but went ahead at the unauthorized venue. It's not the first time Navalny has been detained for staging an unauthorized event. In January, he was held after leading anti-Kremlin rallies across the country that called for voters to boycott the upcoming presidential election. With Putin controlling Russian State TV, Navalny and his supporters have increasingly turned to YouTube to get their message out. Navalny is known for posting online articles about the alleged corrupt practices of Russia's elite. The Kremlin has rejected allegations of widespread high-level corruption and condemned Navalny as a dangerous threat to the country's stability.","author":"Sheena McKenzie and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T09:59:33.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180505084120-01-moscow-anti-putin-protest-0505-alexei-navalny-super-tease.jpg","digest":"sFvG8TpVE5H9V/kt6FfWfQ==\n"}

Here's how it unfolded.","title":"A tiny oral history: Inside the shot that gave Cleveland a 3-0 lead","url":"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23419769/a-tiny-oral-history-cleveland-cavaliers-lebron-james-buzzer-beater-toronto","text":"Check out all the sights and sounds of LeBron James' buzzer-beater to send Toronto to another heartbreaking defeat. (0:59)\n\nCLEVELAND -- OG Anunoby had just made the biggest shot of his rookie season, a rattling 3-pointer with eight seconds left that completed a 17-point Toronto Raptors comeback to tie Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cavaliers.\n\nCavs coach Tyronn Lue called his final timeout and stepped into the huddle.\n\nWhat happened Saturday night in Cleveland will be remembered for quite some time -- in quite different ways.\n\nCavs fans will never forget yet another mind-boggling addition to the long list of late-game LeBron James heroics, drawing specific memories of a similar jaw-dropper he hit against the Chicago Bulls in 2015. Raptors faithful will be talking about it ... very, very differently, and probably not with language we can include.\n\nHere's what followed on Saturday night, from the perspective of those who lived it:\n\nLeBron James, Cavs forward: \"It should never have come down to that point. We had a really good lead to start the fourth, and we came out and didn't execute and didn't play the way we should have.\"\n\nDwane Casey, Raptors coach: \"Well, our goal in the timeout was to trap him and make someone else beat us.\"\n\nJames: \"T. Lue was the one who told us, 'Let's take it full court,' knowing I had more than enough time to get the ball up the court, and by us doing that it doesn't allow the defense to kind of sit and see what you're going to do.\"\n\nThe Cavs ran the same play in Washington in February 2017, when James ended up hitting a memorable banked-in 3-pointer at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. That last-second prayer might not have been necessary if James had made a layup the previous possession after \"3 Open\" got him a great look at the rim.\n\nGeorge Hill, Cavs guard: \"When they came out of the huddle, they didn't expect us to inbound full court. They were confused a little bit.\"\n\nCJ Miles, Raptors forward: \"The reason they took it out from full court was so we can't [double-team]. If you run at him 40 feet from the basket, he can see the whole floor and somebody is getting an open shot.\"\n\nFred VanVleet, Raptors guard: \"Obviously in that position, best-case scenario you get the ball out of his hands.\"\n\nOG Anunoby, Raptors forward: \"We didn't really think about trapping him. Maybe in hindsight.\"\n\nCasey: \"It was probably my fault that I didn't make it clear that we wanted to trap him and get the ball out of his hands.\"\n\nJames: \"I think a coach would sleep a little bit better if they lost the game without me making it.\"\n\nThe Cavs struggled a bit to get the ball in bounds, and both Hill and James came for the ball. When it was inbounded, James was briefly in the corner with Anunoby and Pascal Siakam in position to double-team. But the trap didn't materialize, and James turned the corner. Cavs forward Kevin Love came and set a slip screen to give James some separation from Anunoby.\n\nCasey: \"He split the trap and went 100 miles an hour down the floor and lost them. We just didn't execute.\"\n\nJames: \"I had more than enough time to get the ball from one baseline to the other; that's way more time than I needed. They did a good job of putting pressure on me in the backcourt, and they put two on me first, and I was able to get open.\"\n\nVanVleet: \"The way the play broke down, it was a tough, weird play. And there was really no way for OG to slow him down.\"\n\nKyle Korver, Cavs guard: \"We're spacing [the floor]. Bron is going to put his head down, he's going to get to the basket. It's just, he's hardest to guard when he's got a full head of steam. So, the more space he has, the larger his head of steam.\"\n\nKyle Lowry, Raptors guard: \"You know he's going left.\"\n\nKevin Love, Cavs forward: \"He saw that lane, and I know, to me, it looked like he could've got a little closer, but that rhythm was there for him.\"\n\nWith 1.9 seconds left on the clock and just below the foul line extended, James picked up his dribble and started his move. Anunoby was on him, but Miles stayed in the corner near Korver, instead of helping.\n\nMiles: \"LeBron's shot is way tougher than Kyle shooting the ball in the corner at that moment. He's shooting a one-foot floater from 15 feet with his body facing the crowd. There's no need for me to help off Korver in that situation. I felt that was smart thing to do at that moment.\"\n\nKorver: \"I've seen him shoot that shot countless times at shootaround when he's just like messing around. He'll shoot all these crazy shots all the time. And you're like, 'Man, when would he shoot that shot?' Maybe to win a playoff game, apparently.\"\n\nHill: \"Today was, I guess, the day he pulled that out of the toolbox.\"\n\nJames: \"When do I decide which shot I'm going to take? To be honest, sometimes I really don't know, but I trust every shot that I'm going to take because I work on every shot.\"\n\nLowry: \"He got to his spot. There's not much going through your mind. At that point, you're just like, 'OG, get a contest.'\"\n\nMiles: \"It's the shot you'd want him to take in that situation.\"\n\nLove: \"He knocked it down going to his left, almost fading away a little bit and shooting with one hand.\"\n\nJames: \"The level of difficulty of that is very difficult. Don't try it at home.\"\n\nKorver: \"It looked good the whole way.\"\n\nLue: \"I just knew it went in, I didn't know how it was going [in].\"\n\nLowry: \"I didn't want it to be real.\"\n\nJeff Green, Cavs forward: \"I think everybody this time was just in awe. It's amazing to continue to watch, watch what he does.\"\n\nKorver: \"I think we're expecting him to win the game in the end when it's close. We feel like he's going to make the plays.\"\n\nHill: \"It's satisfying, because he put me out every year [with the Indiana Pacers]. I'm happy to be on the other side.\"\n\nJames: \"I've been doing that since I was like 6, 7, 8 years old. Maybe even before that. There's a picture floating around of me beside a Little Tikes hoop with a saggy Pamper on and I was doing it back then and all the way up until now, at 33.

Giuliani: Mueller may be going after Manafort because he thinks he will 'flip faster' MORE’s pick to lead the CIA, just days before she is scheduled to face a grilling from the Senate Intelligence Committee over her role in the agency’s controversial detention and interrogation program.\n\nFor weeks, the CIA has led the charge on promoting now-deputy director Gina Haspel—a forward-leaning PR campaign that some critics have said is inappropriate for the clandestine agency.\n\nOnly late last week did the White House stand up the kind of broad-based press campaign typical of other high-stakes nominations, issuing a swath of laudatory press releases and briefing reporters.\n\nThe delay, an administration official told The Hill, was intentional.\n\nLetting the agency introduce her, the official said, “reaffirmed the idea that she was nonpartisan and nonpolitical.”\n\n“It made sense in terms of reaffirming that that’s who she is—a career intelligence official who is going to head an intelligence agency and that intelligence agency is the one who had her story to tell.”\n\nThe official stressed that there was no effort to distance Haspel from Trump, who has been deeply critical of the CIA in the past and has faced accusations from critics of politicizing intelligence.\n\nOne GOP source familiar with the confirmation process suggested that the White House hadn’t done enough to combat the narrative that Haspel was heavily involved in the torture program. Human rights groups and some lawmakers are opposing her confirmation over the issue.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the White House on Friday summoned Haspel for a meeting to discuss her role in the controversial program — only to have Haspel signal that she was going to withdraw her nomination if it would avoid what is expected to be a brutal confirmation that could damage both her reputation and the CIA's.\n\nAfter hours of discussions with White House officials, Haspel by late Saturday afternoon had decided to stick with her nomination, the Post reported.\n\nBut the dramatic incident underscores the challenges the White House and the CIA have faced in promoting Haspel—and grimly foreshadows her hearing this week.\n\nThe GOP source claimed that the administration has done far less for Haspel compared to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsDomestic violence survivors seeking asylum in US deserve our protection House Intel report: McCabe said agents who interviewed Flynn 'didn’t think he was lying' Hillicon Valley: Trump holds meeting on election security | New NSA director takes over | Google will start verifying election ads MORE, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and more recently Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoUS ambassador to Mexico officially departs Israel's well-being is a top reason for Trump to rip up the Iran deal Trump is right to blast the disastrous Iran Deal MORE as Secretary of State.\n\n“You’re just not seeing the same amount of coordination or the same amount of urgency to get information out and change the narrative,” the source said.\n\nThe administration official pushed back on that notion, saying that the plan had always been to more aggressively back Haspel after Pompeo was confirmed.\n\n“It wasn’t a White House scramble as much as it was the White House flipping the switch,” the official said.\n\nHaspel has been meeting with lawmakers for weeks, and groups supporting her plan to begin targeting Democrats who represent states won by Trump ahead of her confirmation hearing.\n\n“It is kind of like a campaign style where you have a media strategy nationally and then this sort of in-state strategy for folks who they think are gettable, particularly in the Senate,” said Andy Keiser, a former senior adviser to House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersHillicon Valley: Trump holds meeting on election security | New NSA director takes over | Google will start verifying election ads Senate confirms new Army cyber warfare unit leader Trump: Administration 'seriously thinking' about adding 'Space Force' to military MORE (R-Mich.) and a former Trump transition national security official.\n\nComplicating the efforts to sell Haspel is the fact that most of her history is classified. The agency has provided little by way of detail about her 32-year record — a decision that as acting director, Haspel herself controls.\n\nSome details have been publicly reported. She briefly ran a CIA black-site prison in Thailand in 2002, during a time when the suspect behind the USS Cole bombing was waterboarded three times.\n\nBut the agency has not confirmed that timeline. There is no public evidence that Haspel took part in the interrogations personally.\n\nSome of her fiercest critics, such as Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOn World Press Freedom Day, elected officials must commit to keeping press freedom nonpartisan White House preps 27-page talking point defense for controversial CIA nominee Drug industry faces Trump-fueled storm over prices MORE (D-Ore.), have hinted heavily that her classified record is deeply troubling, while former intelligence officials have praised her as a professional, experienced officer. But even her defenders aren’t able to directly address specifics about her various posts in the agency. Critics lambasted the CIA for publicizing human interest details, like the fact that she is a fan of country music legend Johnny Cash, without addressing her role in the interrogation program.\n\nThe GOP source said the hints and allegations about her previous involvement in the program from the left have proven to be far more successful than the Trump administration’s efforts to rein them in.\n\n“Her role, whatever it was and whatever you think of torture, her role in it is not as deep or not as horrific as Democrats are describing it. The narrative — you’re already losing that, right?” the source said.\n\nBroadly, the agency and the White House have leaned on characterizations of Haspel from former senior intelligence officials — including critics of the Trump administration such as former CIA director John Brennan John Owen BrennanWhite House preps 27-page talking point defense for controversial CIA nominee Ex-CIA director defends Clapper, tells Trump 'Your hypocrisy knows no bounds' Ex-CIA chief: 'Highly partisan' House Intel report means nothing MORE — to respond to allegations that she was an inappropriate champion of techniques now widely considered torture.\n\n“I noted that certainly there are critics who also support her candidacy. I think that speaks to what a strong candidate she is for this role,” Short said during the a press call with reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House circulated an internal 27-page memo this week laying out the administration’s messaging plan for Haspel, including talking points about how her defenders should respond if “pressed on a specific matter,” which appeared to point to her involvement with the program.\n\n“She is an ‘intelligence and national security expert’ who follows the law as written, and has demonstrated strong and clear leadership in very challenging positions,” the memo advises surrogates to say.\n\nThe White House press shop also pushed out multiple emails on Wednesday detailing “widespread praise” of Haspel from current and former national security leaders.\n\nBut those vague assurances aren’t likely to satisfy Haspel’s fiercest critics.\n\nMany of the officials who are praising Haspel were also involved in the post-9/11 program in some way. Former deputy director Michael Morell lead an internal review of Haspel’s role in the 2005 destruction of tapes documenting a pair of brutal interrogations at the prison in Thailand that has been slammed by critics as incomplete.\n\nBrennan, meanwhile, was a senior official at the agency when the program was initially established—a fact that scuttled his own first nomination as CIA director in 2008.\n\nBrennan was confirmed for the position in 2013, after Obama won his second term, and some supports of Haspel have suggested that she is being penalized for being a Trump appointee more than for her role in the program.\n\n“I’m wondering if there’s a double standard here,” Morell said on his podcast “Intelligence Matters” this week.\n\n“The Senate confirmed John Brennan, who was the number-four in the agency when the program was conceived and approved in policy circles, and now they’re challenging a foot-soldier in that program.”","author":"Katie Bo Williams and Olivia Beavers","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T23:03:49.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-hill","name":"The Hill"},"urlToImage":"http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cia_hq_logo_04102018_1.jpg","digest":"bNSb2WjQnaeARVozCYeOeA==\n"}

The country’s currency, the rial, has lost around 35 percent of its value since his re-election in May last year, and his popularity has slipped among the middle classes for having failed to achieve some of the economic and social changes he promised. His opponents in the military and clerical ranks have increased their political attacks against him.\n\nSpeaking to international reporters on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu pushed back against critics who said a trove of pilfered Iranian documents he revealed last week had showed nothing new.\n\n“Anyone who says there is nothing new in the material we showed has not seen the material,” Mr. Netanyahu said, days after exposing Israel’s acquisition of a huge archive of stolen Iranian nuclear plans, mostly relating to a covert bomb-making project that was halted in 2003.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said that the deal was “fatally flawed on weaponization,” referring to the military application of Iran’s enriched uranium, and that the documents proved it was based on a lie. He added that the cache of more than 100,000 pages was now being shared with the intelligence services of the countries who negotiated the agreement with Iran: the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain.\n\nTo those arguing that the documents did not prove any Iranian violation of the accord since it came into effect in 2016, Mr. Netanyahu said that was missing the point.\n\n“If you don’t violate a dangerous deal, it doesn’t make it less dangerous,” he said, adding that the accord was based on “a fictitious Iranian report” to the International Atomic Energy Agency, in which Iran denied having ever planned to build a weapon.\n\nMr. Netanyahu also dismissed experts who said the documents just proved why a deal was necessary. “A deal that enables Iran to keep and hide all its nuclear weapons know-how is a horrible deal,” he said.\n\nThe accord gave Iran “unlimited enrichment in both ways,” he said, because it removed economic sanctions on Tehran and at the same time “gives them the ability to enrich uranium on an industrialized scale” when the restrictions in the deal end.\n\n“The last thing you can say about it is that it blocks all of Iran’s paths to the bomb. In fact, it does the very opposite,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “If you do nothing to this deal, if you keep it as is, you will end up with Iran with a nuclear arsenal in a very short time.”\n\nMr. Netanyahu has staked his political career on blocking Iran and its nuclear ambitions, which pose a potential existential threat to Israel, but there is no sign so far that his campaign has shifted European leaders who have lobbied Mr. Trump not to scuttle the deal.\n\nMany experts, including former Israeli security officials, have said that while the deal may be flawed, it is better than having no deal. The Israeli government argues for the re-imposition of economic sanctions on Tehran, which it says will serve to curb not only Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but also its power in the Middle East.\n\nAn Israeli intelligence official who briefed the foreign reporters, on the condition of anonymity in line with his agency’s rules, said that only a fraction of the stolen Iranian archive had been presented publicly. He added that 99 percent of it was new to Israel in the quantity and quality of information it provided about Iran’s military nuclear project.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said he would be meeting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday in Moscow, amid escalating tensions over Iran’s efforts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. He warned that Israel would do all it could to thwart Iran’s efforts there, even if that meant entering into a conflict.\n\n“In recent months, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards organization has transferred to Syria advanced weaponry in order to attack us both on the battlefield and on the home front,” Mr. Netanyahu said in remarks broadcast on Sunday. He said the weapons included drones, missiles and “antiaircraft batteries that would threaten air force jets.”\n\nThe remarks came as Israel braced for Iranian retaliation for an attack last month on an Iranian drone facility at an air base in Syria.","author":"https://www.nytimes.com/by/isabel-kershner, http://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-erdbrink","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T21:53:05.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/world/07ISRAEL-IRAN/merlin_137753556_3630e072-1011-4ed3-8522-4ce3bd014827-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"sfi7Xnsv54gWMFx3OnbWmQ==\n"}

Photo: yuri gripas/Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s legal team is striking a more combative tone with special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors, a stance likely to further delay the outcome of a probe already under a time crunch because of the approaching midterm election.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who recently joined the president’s defense team, on Sunday raised the possibility of Mr. Trump’s refusing to recognize a subpoena and said he was reluctant to have Mr. Trump testify for fears what he called a “trap” would lead the president to commit perjury under oath. Such a decision would probably set off a legal battle that would be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\n“We don’t have to,” Mr. Giuliani said about complying with a subpoena during an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “I’m gonna walk him into a prosecution for perjury, like Martha Stewart did?” Mr. Giuliani also left open the possibility the president could invoke his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify if forced to appear before a grand jury.\n\nMr. Giuliani is one of several lawyers to join Mr. Trump’s legal team in recent weeks. With those attorneys still reviewing documents, no decision is imminent on whether to have the president sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller, said a person familiar with the legal team’s deliberations.\n\nFor Mr. Mueller, the clock is ticking.\n\nWith six months to go until November’s midterm elections, Mr. Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign will soon run into a dead zone of sorts, in which former prosecutors say they expect him either to wrap up, or lie low and take no visible steps until after the November vote.\n\nThough Mr. Mueller doesn’t face any specific legal deadline, the fall midterms amount to a political one, according to experts and prosecutors. He will reach a point this summer when Justice Department habits dictate he would have to go dark so he doesn’t appear to be trying to sway voters’ decisions, which would be at odds with Justice Department guidelines for prosecutors.\n\nAny action by Mr. Mueller that implicates or exonerates Mr. Trump or his associates in working with Russia or obstructing justice could go a long way to determining whether Democrats take control of one or both houses of Congress. Democrats have promised extra scrutiny of the Trump administration if voters pull the lever for their party in November, while Republican candidates have largely sided with Mr Trump, and some have echoed the president’s message that the prosecution is a witch hunt.\n\nMr. Mueller has a lot still to do—prepare several reports, bring expected charges against alleged Russian hackers behind the breach of the Democratic National Committee and make decisions on whether to prosecute other cases. Perhaps the most politically sensitive issue he has yet to resolve is whether the special counsel’s office will demand an interview with Mr. Trump.\n\nIf he can’t get all those things done in the next few months, his probe is likely to stretch into 2019.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump said he wants to agree to an interview with Mr. Mueller but said his lawyers have counseled him otherwise.\n\nAgreeing to a voluntary interview would allow Mr. Trump’s lawyers to set conditions, including the length of the talk, the topics raised and whether Mr. Trump could be accompanied by counsel. If he refused and was subpoenaed, the interview conditions would be much less favorable to Mr. Trump.\n\n“When you volunteer, at least maybe you can constrain the questions. When you’re subpoenaed, a subpoena is broad. Your lawyer isn’t present. This is a tough decision for the president’s team to make,” Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who has defended Mr. Trump in television appearances, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nMr. Mueller raised the possibility of issuing a grand jury subpoena in a March interview with the president’s previous attorneys, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\nThe probe to date has produced five public guilty pleas—largely for lying to investigators or for conduct unrelated to the 2016 campaign. A sixth defendant, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, is scheduled to face trial on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from alleged misconduct that largely predated the presidential election. Mr. Mueller has also charged 13 Russians with election interference.\n\nBut Mr. Mueller has begun to refer some new matters to other U.S. attorneys’ offices, including the investigation into the president’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, suggesting the special counsel’s office is trying to avoid taking on new matters that could prolong its primary investigation.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, who is recused from the Mueller investigation, said in late April that he understood Mr. Trump’s unhappiness with how long Mr. Mueller’s investigations seems to be taking. “This thing needs to conclude,” Mr. Sessions told a House budget hearing.\n\nAccording to the handbook for federal prosecutors, the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual, Justice Department employees are barred from using their official authority “to interfere with or affect the result of an election.”\n\nThe rules aren’t explicit, but a March 2012 memo from then-Attorney General Eric Holder also instructed Justice Department employees to be “particularly sensitive to safeguarding the Department’s reputation for fairness, neutrality, and nonpartisanship.” Specifically, he told law-enforcement officers and prosecutors to never time investigative steps or criminal charges “for the purpose of affecting any election” or to give “an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.”\n\nPreet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said if an investigation becomes public during a politically sensitive time, prosecutors should seek to resolve it as quickly as they responsibly can.\n\n“I think it is the obligation of every reasonable prosecutor to minimize the duration of that cloud or cause lightning to strike as quickly as possible,” Mr. Bharara said.\n\nJames Comey, the former Federal Bureau of Investigation director, weighed those considerations and opted to alert Congress 11 days before the 2016 election that the FBI had reopened an investigation into then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email use.\n\nTwo days before polls closed, Mr. Comey told Congress the agency had reviewed the new evidence and found no reason to change its earlier recommendation that Mrs. Clinton face no charges related to her email practices, but many Democrats blamed Mr. Comey’s initial disclosure for Mrs. Clinton’s loss.\n\nIn a recent onstage interview with Axios, Mr. Comey was asked about whether he would have any advice to Mr. Mueller about “coming out and saying something.”\n\n“It’s worked well for me,” Mr. Comey deadpanned to audience laughter. “Ah, God,” he sighed, to more laughter from the audience.\n\n“There aren’t any rules around how we act in the run-up to an election…there’s a norm, you avoid any action in the run-up to an election that might have an impact, if you can,” Mr. Comey said, adding that he was “sure” Mr. Mueller would “operate with that norm in mind.”\n\nWhen Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, he initially cited a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticizing Mr. Comey’s public actions around the Clinton investigation as a “textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.”\n\nThe problem isn’t unique to presidential elections. The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office investigated New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2016, and that summer people close to the mayor asked prosecutors if they could wrap up the probe or bring any charges by the fall, so the investigation wouldn’t spill over into his re-election campaign in 2017. Prosecutors didn’t announce until March 2017 that they had decided against charging Mr. de Blasio or his aides or allies. Mr. de Blasio won re-election that November.\n\n—Gabriel T.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aef97bb5a90676be2aa322b"},"description":"\"This is unfortunately not the end,” Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said Saturday.","title":"'A very fast-moving situation': Lava shoots through Hawaii neighborhood as new fissures form","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/06/a-very-fast-moving-situation-lava-shoots-through-hawaii-neighborhood-as-new-fissures-form/","text":"Less than a week ago, Leilani Estates was the picture of serenity on Hawaii’s Big Island, a subdivision in the island’s eastern Puna district filled with wooden homes nestled in tropical plant-filled lots.\n\nThe eruption of the island’s most active volcano changed everything.\n\nShortly after Kilauea erupted Thursday, the ground split open on the east side of Leilani Estates, exposing an angry red beneath the lush landscape. From the widening gash, molten rock burbled and splashed, then shot as high as 80 to 100 feet in the air.\n\nThe Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency called it “active volcanic fountaining.” Some residents insisted it was Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, come to reclaim her land. Residents there were ordered to flee amid threats of fires and “extremely high levels of dangerous” sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nSoon, another such fissure had formed less than three streets to the west. Then another, and another. From the vents, hot steam — and noxious gases — rose, before magma broke through and splattered into the air.\n\nAs of Sunday morning local time, at least 10 such fissure vents were reported in the neighborhood, including two that had opened anew late Saturday night. The fissures are forming along a northeast-southwest line in the rift zone, and not all of the older fissures are actively spewing lava, said Wendy Stovall, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n“As the eruption progresses, there will become a preferred pathway for the magma to go through,” Stovall said. “Some of the outer vents along this fissure line will start to close up and congeal because the lava is going to essentially harden.”\n\nOnce that happens, lava fountains from the remaining open vents can shoot even higher — reaching up to 1,000 feet, Stovall said. On Saturday, lava from one of the newer fissures spurted as high as 230 feet into the air, according to the Geological Survey.\n\nMore outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone, officials said.\n\nDrone footage showed lava spouting along the fissures that had formed, creeping toward Leilani Estates homes and leaving lines of smoldering trees in their wake. The flows destroyed or cut off several streets in the neighborhood, typically home to about 1,700 people — before most of them evacuated last week.\n\nMeanwhile, over the past few days, some photographers have followed the fissures, posting dramatic photos and videos of lava spattering into the air or oozing across roads. Officials have urged everyone to leave Leilani Estates, where a mandatory evacuation order remains in force.\n\n“Being in Hawaii and being around lava you get used to the way it behaves and so you kind of become comfortable around it,” Stovall said. “[The lava flows] are mesmerizing to see. I understand why people want to see them but it’s not advisable. It’s a dangerous situation.”\n\nThe county civil defense agency put it more bluntly in an advisory Sunday: “Please, the residents of Leilani need your help by staying out of the area. This is not the time for sightseeing.”\n\nThe agency announced Sunday that certain Leilani Estates residents might be able to return briefly to their homes to retrieve pets, medicine or important items left behind — but would need to leave immediately afterward because of “the very unstable conditions of air quality and of the roads.”\n\nAt least nine homes in the subdivision have been destroyed by fire, according to Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim.\n\n“This is a very fast-moving situation,” Kim told Hawaii News Now. “This is unfortunately not the end.”\n\nKilauea first erupted Thursday, sending fountains of lava gushing out of the ground and billowing clouds of steam and volcanic ash into the sky on the eastern side of the island.\n\nThree days later, some residents there continue to suffer through a triple whammy of threats. From below, lava has spewed forth out of an increasing number of fissures that have opened up in the ground, oozing toward homes.\n\nSeveral earthquakes — including the strongest to hit Hawaii in more than four decades — have jolted the Big Island’s residents, some as they were in the midst of evacuating.\n\nAnd in the air, noxious fumes from the volcano are what some officials say could be the greatest threat to public health in the wake of its eruption.\n\nAfter the eruption Thursday, the island shook at regular intervals, but especially around midday Friday: A 5.6-magnitude quake hit south of the volcano around 11:30 a.m., followed about an hour later by a 6.9-magnitude temblor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe latter was felt as far away as Oahu and struck in nearly the exact same place as a deadly 7.4-magnitude earthquake in 1975, according to the Geological Survey.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed homes visibly shaking, items clattering to the floor at supermarkets and waves forming in swimming pools as the 6.9-magnitude quake rattled.\n\n“I think the whole island felt it,” said Cori Chong, who was in her bedroom with her foster dog, Monty, when the 6.9-magnitude quake struck, frightening both of them. Even though Chong lives on the Hamakua coast, about an hour north of the earthquake’s epicenter, the shaking in her home was so violent that it caused furniture to move and glass to shatter.\n\nDavid Burlingame, who lives about two miles west of Leilani Estates, told The Washington Post that he and a friend ran outside when the earthquake hit “and watched my house just shake back and forth.”\n\n“Everybody is kind of on edge,” Burlingame said Saturday of both the potential for additional earthquakes and the unpredictability of the lava flows. “The worst part is kind of waiting to see, because you really never can tell what can happen.”\n\nThe earthquakes also prompted the rare closure of Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park after they damaged some of the park’s trails, craters and roads. The first earthquake triggered a cliff to collapse into the ocean, and fissures began to appear in the ground at a popular overlook near the Jaggar Museum.\n\nPark officials said they canceled hikes Friday and evacuated about 2,600 visitors, along with all nonemergency employees.\n\n“Safety is our main priority at Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, and it is currently not safe to be here,” park superintendent Cindy Orlando said in a statement. “We will monitor the situation closely, and reopen when it is safe to do so.”\n\nThe county civil defense agency reported that the threat of a tsunami was low after the earthquakes, though officials warned that residents were not in the clear yet.\n\n“Everything is still elevated,” agency administrator Talmadge Magno said, according to Hawaii News Now. “It kind of gets you nervous.”\n\nThursday’s eruption prompted the County of Hawaii’s managing director, Wil Okabe, to issue a state of emergency declaration. Gov. David Ige (D) also issued an emergency proclamation and activated Hawaii’s National Guard to help with evacuations.\n\nJordan Sonner, a Big Island Realtor, was on another part of the island taking pictures for an upcoming listing Thursday when she “got the call that there was lava in Leilani” and rushed back to her home, just outside Leilani Estates.\n\n“To describe it in a single word: chaos,” Sonner said of the evacuation in an interview with The Post on Saturday. “My immediate threat was not the lava. It was the sulfur dioxide gas.”\n\nIt took Sonner about an hour and a half to reach her home, grab important documents and her pets — four dogs and a chinchilla — and scramble back out of there, she said. She’s now staying with a friend in Mountain View, about 20 miles northwest of Leilani Estates, and expects it could be a long while before it’s safe for residents to return.\n\n“It’s so hard to tell what is going to happen because it’s just so early. This volcano being a shield volcano, the way that it erupts, it just erupts slowly,” Sonner said. “We kind of just have to sit and wait to see what direction the lava is going to flow in and what other fissures are going to open up. This is far from over.”\n\nWhen asked whether she was afraid she would lose her home, Sonner paused, before describing the uniqueness of the community there.\n\n“The way I kind of look at it is, the land doesn’t really belong to us. It belongs to Pele,” Sonner said, referring to the Hawaiian volcano goddess. “We get to live on it while we can, and if she wants it back, she’ll take it. I have good insurance.”\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, at least a few hundred people had evacuated their homes in Leilani Estates and nearby Lanipuna Gardens, taking refuge at local churches, Red Cross shelters, and with family and friends in other parts of Hawaii, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nGabbard warned that, in some ways, the threat from the sulfur dioxide gas could be more dangerous than the lava flows, which had stopped in places after the eruption. If conditions worsened, even first responders would not be able to go into the affected neighborhoods to help trapped residents, she added.\n\n“Sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal, especially to those who have respiratory illnesses,” Gabbard said. “The wind can push [the gas] in different directions, so that’s a very serious concern given the high levels, and, you know, people don’t necessarily have the kinds of protective gas masks that they would need if they were right in the thick of this gas.”\n\nKilauea is the youngest and most active volcano on Hawaii Island, according to the USGS. The eruption from the volcano came hours after a 5.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the island Thursday morning. As The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reported, Kilauea is made of basalt, a fluid lava that makes for effusive — rather than explosive — eruptions:\n\nGeologists said the current seismic activities around Puna most closely resemble the events that precipitated a 1955 eruption, according to Hawaii News Now. That eruption lasted about three months and left almost 4,000 acres of land covered in lava, the news site reported.\n\nMore recently in 2014, lava again threatened the Puna district, specifically the town of Pahoa and its surrounding area, The Post reported. During that event, lava flowed as quickly as 20 yards per hour, and up to 60 structures were at risk.\n\nLindsey Bever and Allyson Chiu contributed to this report.\n\nHawaii might be about to ban your favorite sunscreen to protect its coral reefs\n\nHawaii missile alert: How one employee ‘pushed the wrong button’ and caused a wave of panic","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T16:18:15.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXiiN0jsLtjimkkn77xy9b4Hyuc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LIB3445AQMZFNDBWTBVTM6FQ3Q.jpg","digest":"RWUcmZceyoSWD7PYdGd+Mw==\n"}

He said he would’ve voted for Trump,” Glover says, catching the attention of the others. “He has the hat, everything. Trump signed it.

As was the case during his interviews last week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to speak largely off the cuff. He speculated freely and contradicted himself, sometimes from one statement to the next.\n\nHe said, for example, that Mr. Mueller would be to blame if Mr. Trump refused to testify because his office had leaked a list of questions that the special counsel would like to ask him. But then he admitted he did not know who leaked the questions, which were reported by The New York Times.\n\nMr. Giuliani referred repeatedly to a federal judge’s criticism of the special counsel’s fraud case against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign. The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said on Friday that the case seemed motivated by a desire to get Mr. Manafort to potentially incriminate Mr. Trump.\n\n“There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.”\n\nMr. Giuliani created a furor on Wednesday when he contradicted the president about the payment to Ms. Clifford. Speaking on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Ms. Clifford, to keep her from making public a story about an affair she claims she had with Mr. Trump — a claim that he denies. When asked in April by reporters traveling on Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said he did not.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he was still trying to establish when Mr. Trump learned that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. But he added that as a legal matter, it did not matter since the payment did not violate federal campaign finance rules.\n\nAsked about the discrepancies between his account and the president’s statement, Mr. Giuliani said: “Those don’t amount to anything — what is said to the press.

Here are just three from day one:\n\nAn Interview with Our Forever First Lady\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama, the main attraction of the two-day event, sat down to be interviewed by actress Tracee Ellis Ross. And as expected there was a smorgasbord of great moments. For one, Obama believes that as women we need to shake things up more for the next generation.\n\n“So many of us have gotten ourselves at the table, but we're still too grateful to be at the table to really shake it up,” she said. “That's not a criticism, because for so many, just getting to the table was so hard, so you're just holding on. But now we have to take some risks for our girls . . . just holding onto our seats at the table won't be enough to help our girls be all that they can be.”\n\nAnd Obama confirmed —again—that she would not be running for president.\n\n\n\nThis All-Black Women’s Panel Was Everything\n\nThe crowd was here for all the black girl magic that graced the mainstage when former Teen Vogue editor Elaine Welteroth moderated a conversation between Senator Kamala Harris, actress and activist Yara Shahidi and activist Brittany Packnett on Saturday.\n\n“Most of us have been in many situations…where we are the only one that looks like us,” Harris told the audience. “I want everyone to look around the room and see the numbers, and remember that when you are in that room, we are in the room with you.”\n\n\n\nMore Funding For Black Women Entrepreneurs\n\nOne of the most exciting pieces of news from the summit came from venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton of Backstage Capital. Hamilton announced that her firm would be investing $36 million specifically towards black women!\n\nYes, you read that right!\n\nBackstage Capital has committed to invest in black female founders $1 million at a time.\n\n“They're calling it a ‘diversity fund’,” Hamilton tweeted. “I'm calling it an IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME fund.”\n\nWe are here for ALL.

But after the papers were signed, he miraculously regained consciousness.\n\nThe incident happened two months ago, when McKinley was playing at a friend’s house in Alabama. While the teen was riding in a small utility trailer being pulled by a dune buggy, his friend suddenly hit the brakes and caused the trailer to flip.\n\n“I hit the concrete and the trailer landed on top of my head,” recalled McKinley, speaking to Fox 10. “After that, I don’t remember anything.”\n\nHis mother, Jennifer Reindl, told the outlet that her son had been dead for 15 minutes when she arrived at USA Medical Center in Mobile.\n\n“All I saw was a stretcher with his feet hanging out. He was dead a total of 15 minutes,” she said, adding that doctors prepared her for the worst. “When he came back, they said he would never be normal again. They told me the oxidation problems would be so bad to his brain, that he would be a vegetable if he even made it.”\n\nAfter days of being brain dead, McKinley’s parents decided to donate his organs to five children in need that were a match for the teen.\n\n“They said the next time his heart stopped they had to let him die….this was a [Saturday]….or I could sign a paper to donate his organs to save five other kids….and they would keep hitting him with adrenaline till monday….so I signed it,” Reindl wrote on a Facebook page set up to help raise funds for his recovery. “His eyes were solid black and dry and I knew he would not hesitate to save 5 more lives.”\n\nShe continued, “The next day I got a call….they canceled the final brain wave test….right before they hooked him up his hand moved Then his feet…so they looked at his eyes and they were back….he had blue eyes….now they are green with small white specks like glitter…they say when you look upon god…pigment changes…and my baby was in heaven for a whole day….he is a miracle.”\n\nHowever, McKinley began showing signs of brain activity just one day before doctors were set to take him off life support.\n\nMcKinley suffered multiple skull fractures as well as kidney failure “due to the lack of oxygen after his cardiac arrest,” according to the Facebook page. Fox 10 reported that he continues to suffer from nerve pain and seizures every day, but he’s keeping a positive attitude.\n\n“I said I could turn sideways and put salsa in there and eat chips and dip out of my head,” he joked to Fox 10. “No more washing dishes for me!”\n\nHe’s had three brain surgeries and continues to make progress as he recovers at home. A video posted to Facebook showed McKinley sinking a basketball into a hoop at rehab last month, while another showed him taking a stroll with the help of a walker.\n\nMcKinley told Fox 10 that he feels he was in heaven while he was unconscious.\n\n“I was in an open field walking straight,” he explained. “There’s no other explanation but God. There’s no other way. Even doctors said it.”","author":"Stephanie Petit","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T20:47:52.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"People.com"},"urlToImage":"https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/trenton.jpg?crop=2px%2C53px%2C1489px%2C781px\u0026resize=1200%2C630","digest":"hC+Xni+K06/vYoapywSXrA==\n"}

But she was more excited about her home, right outside the Leilani Estates subdivision, and being a first-time homeowner.\n\n\"At the time, I understood it as a possibility,\" she said. But she never thought it would be a reality.\n\nNow Sonner's neighborhood is at the center of an unfolding emergency after the Kilauea volcano erupted Thursday, spewing molten rocks and high levels of sulfur dioxide into the area.\n\nBy Sunday, at least nine homes had been destroyed as a result of the eruption, which was followed by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake on Friday -- the island's most powerful since 1975, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, nine volcanic vents had erupted in evacuated neighborhoods on the island, County of Hawaii officials said.\n\nAll residents of Leilani Estates, a community of about 1,700 people near the Big Island's eastern edge, and nearby Lanipuna Gardens have been ordered to evacuate.\n\nStill, she wishes she'd been able to grab more things,\n\n\"Just basically heartbreak,\" he said of the scene. \"My wife and I have been married going on 26 years. It was pretty much our dream home that we've been looking for all this time. Just knowing that we're not going to have a house, my wife is still in tears.\"\n\n\"The area continues to be unstable with volcanic venting and related hazards of earthquake and poisonous gases ongoing,\" the Hawaii Civil Defense Agency said Saturday night.\n\nNew photos released by the USGS showed a wall of molten lava that came from the seventh fissure in Leilani Estates and a new crack in one of the subdivision's roads.\n\n\"Vents continue to open up, so we lost a few more structures,\" he said. \"I'm pretty happy that we did evacuated the whole neighborhood and unfortunately some people are still in there and we need to get them out. The gases are still high.\"\n\nSome first responders have felt the affects of the gas, he said.\n\nSonner was at work this week when she heard that lava had erupted in her neighborhood.\n\n\"It was a moment of panic,\" she said, \"because the only thing I knew was, 'lava in Leilani.'\"\n\nThis time she was ready. She had bags packed with her clothes, important documents and whatever her dogs would need. The only other item she took was a chain necklace that belonged to her late father.\n\n\"I've always said that's the only thing I would run back into a burning building for, barring people and animals,\" she said. \"There wasn't anything that important.\"\n\nCorey Hale is one of the residents staying at the Pahoa Community Center. She was originally staying with a friend, but later chose to camp out in the parking lot.\n\n\"I wanted to be around a lot of people,\" Hale said. \"It just felt better.\" Volunteers there have kept evacuees safe, well-fed and have plenty of hot coffee ready in the mornings.\n\nStill, Hale wishes she'd been able to get more things from her home in Lanipuna Gardens before she left, like a compass that belonged to her great-grandfather, and other family heirlooms.\n\n\"At this point, I've got what I've got on my back,\" she said. \"I didn't realize until this morning, I've got one pair of shoes.\"\n\nHe didn't know what would become of his house, one he built with his own hands.\n\n\"Now it's trying to figure out what the future brings. ... My work. My job. Am I going to have to move to somewhere else on the island?\"\n\n\"I'd have to start over at age 56,\" Gebbie said. \"That's concerning.\"\n\nSonner's been staying with a friend since she fled her home. While her home is likely safe from lava, she still hasn't been back since Friday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake. And she doesn't know when she'll get to go back.\n\n\"It's difficult,\" she said, \"because everything is so uncertain.\"","author":"Dakin Andone, Susannah Cullinane and Steve Almasy, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T19:49:45.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180506170719-hawaii-leilani-lava-super-tease.jpg","digest":"48cr8SqF4K48cywFuIT7tg==\n"}

Two men in their 20s were shot outside an East Garfield Park building just hours after two other people were shot on the exact same block Sunday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Police had previously been hopeful that gun violence was on a downward trend after seeing more than 1,400 total homicides between 2016 and 2017.

Two women were shot outside of Mount Sinai Hospital while waiting for news on the condition of a relative shot earlier that morning.\n\nWhile police have noted that many of the dozens of shootings this week appear to be gang-related, the majority of victims are under 30 including several teenagers and a 12-year-old boy on the city's Westside. Additionally, a 4-year-old girl was shot in the shoulder Tuesday as she sat with her parents on the family's South Side porch. A 15-year-old boy was struck in the head by a bullet Wednesday afternoon as he rode a city bus home from school. The boy is listed in stable condition and police told USA Today they believe he was was not targeted, but instead was hit by errant gunfire.\n\n\"It infuriates me that we have a good kid doing what we all expect him to do, and he's a victim of something like this,\" Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters. \"This is why we have to have common sense gun legislation in this country.

Lava fountains emerging from the cracks in the ground are producing even more gas than previously observed.\n\nThe USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Sunday afternoon that since the overnight hours, eruptions of lava from cracks in the ground have been continuous. A flow of lava has advanced northward for about 0.6 miles.\n\nResidents have been evacuated from two remote, rural neighborhoods on the eastern edge of Hawaii Island where the lava is emerging from the fissures. An estimated 1,800 people live in the affected area, and many have sought housing in shelters, with friends or on surrounding islands.\n\n“Scientists on the ground are reporting that lava flows are traveling through the forest, power lines are coming down, and a few explosions have been heard — likely from propane tanks or methane explosions,” Stovall said.\n\nAs lava inundates the heavily forested area, organic matter burns and releases methane. “That methane gas can get trapped in pockets beneath lava flows or underground, and explode out violently, throwing rocks and debris in every direction,” Stovall said.\n\nEruptions of lava fountains continued throughout the night. Because lava by Sunday morning was flowing farther than it did in the first days of the eruption, “that means the magma supply is still present and shows signs of continuing,” Stovall said.\n\nBy Sunday morning on Hawaii, the overall number of total cracks that have at one point spewed or sputtered lava had risen to 10. On Saturday night, a new crack erupted between fissures No. 2 and No. 7, spewing lava fountains as high as 230 feet.\n\nThe flows are still moving quite slowly, however — scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey monitoring them can walk away from the hot lava easily. On Sunday, a lava flow was moving away from Fissure No. 8 at significantly less than 1 mph, Stovall said.\n\nImages posted by the USGS showed red hot lava rising higher than the tops of trees. Other photos showed cracks in the ground and lava pouring over the asphalt of rural roads. On Friday, lava spatter was being launched over power lines.\n\nLocal government officials said if conditions permit, residents in Leilani Estates, the neighborhood where the eruptions have been occurring, would be allowed to enter the neighborhood to complete the evacuation of pets, medicine and key documents, but only during daylight hours.\n\nAuthorities warned that the air quality remained troublesome and that the roads were still under very unstable conditions, and residents could be required to leave the area if conditions became more hazardous. Another neighborhood, Lanipuna Gardens, remains under a mandatory evacuation order because of the high levels of toxic gases in the air.\n\nThe volcanic instability at Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes and Hawaii Island’s youngest, began on Monday underneath the eastern flank of the volcano, an area known as the East Rift Zone.\n\nIt was the collapse of a lava-filled crater in the East Rift Zone on Monday that set off this week’s eruption. The contents of the crater seeped into a network of underground channels and flowed downhill — and on Thursday started gushing out of cracks that had opened in Leilani Estates.\n\nThere have been more than 1,000 earthquakes over the last week in the area of Kilauea, produced by the volcano making room for new flows of magma occurring inside of it.\n\nThe largest so far was a magnitude 6.9 earthquake that hit midday Friday in the zone of volcanic activity. Although the earthquake could be felt across much of the archipelago, the worst shaking occurred in an area with no neighborhoods or businesses.\n\nIt is not unheard of for strong earthquakes — even those bigger than magnitude 6.9 — to follow volcanic activity. As molten rock moved underground from the collapsed lava-filled crater in the East Rift Zone to a lower elevation, the moving magma increased pressure in the entire area, Stovall said.\n\n“The closest resort areas, in Kona and the Kohala Coast on the island of Hawaii’s west side, are more than 100 miles away from where the lava flow is occurring and shielded by the massive mountains of Maunakea and Maunaloa. Resort areas located on Oahu and Kauai, and in Maui County, are located hundreds of miles from Kilauea volcano,” said a statement by the Hawaii Tourism Authority.\n\n5:43 p.m.: This article was updated with news that 21 homes have been destroyed in the Hawaii lava flows\n\n4:10 p.m.: This article was updated to include news that a lava flow was moving away from Fissure No. 8 at significantly less than 1 mps, and that eruptions of lava from cracks in the ground have been continuous since Saturday night, and that a flow of lava has advanced northward for about 0.6 miles.\n\nThis article was originally published at 1:50 p.m.","author":"Rong-Gong Lin II, Heidi Chang","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T01:07:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Latimes.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.latimes.com/resizer/SOqJeob975Q8QhY84Ozc8w9Ezzs=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5aefa7f2/turbine/la-na-hawaii-volcano-earthquake-20180506","digest":"UdqIvL7GN98ggZO6fI1oig==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aefb8dd5a90676be2aa32bd"},"description":"The latest on Sunday's two Game 4s.","title":"NBA playoffs: The Jazz are in an early hole (again) against the Rockets; Warriors have stopped messing around","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/06/nba-playoffs-game-4-warriors-pelicans-and-rockets-jazz/","text":"The New Orleans Pelicans couldn’t get it done against the Golden State Warriors and fall behind in the series 3-1. The Utah Jazz are hoping to avoid a similar  hate against the Houston Rockets. Follow along here for the latest analysis and commentary from The Post’s NBA reporter Tim Bontemps, and ask him questions in the comments section. Catch up on yesterday’s games here.\n\n• The Warriors stopped messing around in Game 4 and put the New Orleans in a 3-1 hole as the series shifts back to Oakland.\n\n• Golden State doesn’t need Steph Curry to be great. The team has Kevin Durant after all to carry the load.\n\n• Steve Kerr isn’t comfortable calling his smallball lineup the Hamptons Five, apparently. “I can’t say that. But you can.”\n\nSomething to monitor after this game: There appeared to be some kind of issue with Chris Paul’s brother, C.J., during this game.\n\nAt one point, he was escorted from his seat by security, with both Rockets Coach Mike D’Antoni and Paul himself protesting the decision.\n\nNow, though, C.J. Paul is back in his seat, with the Rockets up by 13 in the fourth quarter. Utah was the home to multiple issues with Russell Westbrook during the first round, remember, including him getting into confrontations with fans at both halftime and at the conclusion of Game 6 of their first round series.\n\nThe Jazz are doing their best to hang around. But the Rockets simply have too much firepower – and that’s on a night when they aren’t hitting threes.\n\nThrough three quarters, Houston leads 79-65, with Chris Paul (23 points, nine assists) and James Harden (21 points) as the only Rockets in double-figures. That’s because Houston is a combined 8 for 31 from three-point range in this game.\n\nThe problem for the Jazz? They are only 6 for 24. Against a team like this, Utah simply has to make outside shots. If it’s not, like it isn’t today, it’s in real trouble.\n\nSo far, Game 4 of Rockets-Jazz has been Chris Paul and James Harden vs. Donovan Mitchell. And while the rookie has acquitted himself quite well after a slow start, that’s a battle Houston is going to win most of the time.\n\nThe Rockets lead 58-48 at halftime, with Harden scoring 18 points (14 coming in the first quarter) while Paul added 12 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Mitchell, meanwhile, has 15 points of his own to go with two rebounds and two assists.\n\nBut Dante Exum has nine points as the next leading scorer for the Jazz … and he didn’t even play in the second quarter because of foul trouble. Someone else on Utah besides Mitchell needs to step up to give the Jazz a real chance in this one.\n\nChris Paul is a terrific player. But he can be exhausting to watch.\n\nTake this play at the end of the first half of Game 4 against the Jazz. Paul made a great play to steal the ball with a few seconds left in the half, but instead of going upcourt to get a shot to close out the half, he tried to draw a three-shot foul on Joe Ingles 75 feet from the basket.\n\nThen, when the foul wasn’t called, Paul flung the ball back toward the opposite basket, and as the horn sounded to end the half intentionally ran into Ingles again and waved his hand at the referees as he walked off the court. Mike D’Antoni then went and gave referee Ken Mauer a piece of his mind, as well.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff Paul tries to do all the time. He’s the guy who tries to find every possible loophole in the rules – and then exploit them.\n\nWhich, again, is why he can be both great and exhausting.\n\nThe Jazz have enough trouble scoring without Donovan Mitchell having any issues. Early here in Game 4, though, it appears he might have one.\n\nMitchell left the bench for a short time in the second quarter of Game 2, only to emerge with a tape job on two of the fingers on his left hand. He eventually checked back into the game, but has been all-but invisible since then.\n\nJoe Ingles has been operating as the point guard offensively, with Mitchell standing in the corner primarily, though he later attacked the rim twice, making one layup and missing another.\n\nUtah needs Mitchell to get going if they want any chance to compete in this game. Otherwise, the Jazz simply don’t have enough firepower to keep up.\n\nThe first quarter of Game 4 went much better than in Game 3 for the Jazz, but it still ended with the same result.\n\nHouston leads Utah 30-23 after one here in Salt Lake City, where James Harden already has 14 points – and, more importantly, has gotten the Jazz into foul trouble.\n\nDante Exum, who scored nine points for the Jazz, picked up three fouls – including two in a row late in the quarter when Harden drew contact and got a favorable whistle. Jae Crowder, who started in place of Derrick Favors, picked up a pair himself.\n\nThe Jazz, predictably, came out with far better energy in Game 4, and the Rockets looked a bit more complacent than they did Friday night. But, in the end, the Jazz were always likely to have issues keeping up with Houston on the scoreboard. And, so far in this game, that’s proving to be true once again.\n\nWith the Jazz already missing Ricky Rubio, the last thing they need is another injury to a perimeter player.\n\nBut Rubio’s replacement in the starting lineup, Royce O’Neale, left the game in its opening minutes after banging knees with a Rockets player and went straight to the locker room.\n\nO’Neale has returned to the bench, where he is flexing his left leg still. It remains to be seen if he’ll be back, but Utah could use him – particularly after he scored 17 points as one of the few brights spots in Utah’s Game 3 loss.\n\nAfter Golden State’s dominant victory in Game 4 over New Orleans, a reporter asked Warriors Coach Steve Kerr a question about the “Hamptons Five” – the small lineup featuring the five players who met in the Hamptons two summers ago – Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, plus the man they were there to recruit: Kevin Durant.\n\nBut when the questioner was finished, Kerr couldn’t help but go back to the idea of calling the lineup the “Hamptons Five” – and that it’s just become the default name for the group.\n\n“I still am amused that we just matter of factly call them the Hamptons Five,” Kerr told reporters with a smile. “[The Athletic’s] Tim Kawakami deserves all the credit then.\n\n“I just feel strange, as a coach saying, ‘Well, the Hamptons Five played well tonight.’\n\n“I can’t say that. But you can.”\n\nKawakami is the one who came up with that phrase after Durant chose to join the Warriors in July of 2016, after that fateful string of meetings in the Hamptons where teams came to meet him and make their respective pitches.\n\nIt was a way to differentiate from the “Death Lineup,” which is what Golden State’s original smallball lineup under Kerr – featuring the four Warriors who met with Durant along with Harrison Barnes – came to be known as.\n\nBut while it’s been picked up by just about everyone outside of the Warriors locker room, at least, it appears Kerr isn’t quite on board with it.\n\nAnd regardless of what it’s called, it clearly worked like a charm in Game 4.\n\nWhile Jazz guard Ricky Rubio’s hamstring will keep him out for Game 4 against the Rockets, forward Derrick Favors sounds likely to play through a sprained ankle.\n\nJazz Coach Quin Snyder said before the game that Favors was going to through workouts pregame before a determination would be made on his status. But Favors was seen walking through the locker room after Houston’s blowout win in Game 3 with only some light tape on his ankle. It would be surprising if he sits out.\n\nThe Warriors stopped messing around. As a result, they took back control of their Western Conference semifinal with the Pelicans.\n\nGoing to their best lineup – Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala – for Game 4 Sunday afternoon served as the catalyst it was expected it would be. Golden State jumped out to an early 14-4 lead and never trailed in an eventual 118-92 victory in New Orleans. The win moved the Warriors to within one victory of advancing to a fourth straight Western Conference finals – a victory they can get Tuesday when they face the Pelicans back in Oakland in Game 5.\n\nKevin Durant was unguardable Sunday, scoring 38 points on 15-for-27 shooting, once again exposing the Pelicans’ lack of size defending on the wing. Stephen Curry had a late spurt to finish with 23 points in 32 minutes, as well, while continuing to ease himself back into game action after returning in Game 2 of this series from five-and-a-half weeks sidelined with a sprained MCL.\n\nAnthony Davis led the Pelicans with 26 points, 12 rebounds, an assist, a steal and two blocks, and E’Twuan Moore added 20 for New Orleans. Nikola Mirotic, however, went just 1 for 7 from the field, as the strategy of having Iguodala guard him – as he did in the first two games when Golden State went small – again paid off.\n\nNew Orleans also shot 4 for 26 from three. Golden State didn’t shoot well from behind the arc, either, going just 11 for 33. But against a team like the Warriors, being outscored by 21 points from behind the arc – not to mention committing 19 turnovers that became 21 Golden State points – is fatal.\n\nThere has been plenty of debate over the past week about whether Stephen Curry is going to be fully healthy for this playoff run, like he clearly wasn’t two years ago when Golden State lost in seven games to Cleveland in the NBA Finals.\n\nHere’s the thing, though: Those Warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant. These Warriors do.\n\nSo while Curry has been solid, but unspectacular again in Game 4, Durant has been dominant. With 29 points, eight rebounds and four assists in 26 minutes so far, Durant has been the difference maker in this series – just as he has been from the moment he arrived in the Bay Area as a free agent two years ago.\n\nComing into this series, the main stylistic difference between these two teams was that the Pelicans had no one who could credibly guard Durant. As Game 4 is proving, that remains the case.\n\nGame 4 has seen the Warriors give the Pelicans their best shot – and the home team is still standing.\n\nThat’s an awfully impressive thing for the Pelicans to be able to say. The question now is if they can not just remain standing, but come out on top.\n\nWhat once was an 18-point Golden State lead has been cut all the way down to as little as four late in the first half, and now stands at 58-51 at halftime in New Orleans.\n\nIt’s an awfully strange box score, though. Golden State is shooting 52.1 percent; New Orleans is shooting 38.1 percent. Golden State has an edge in fast break points (9-7) and have committed three turnovers that have become five Pelicans points, compared to eight Pelicans turnovers becoming 14 points for Golden State.\n\nSo how are the Pelicans in this game? They have gone 18 for 19 from the foul line. The Warriors, on the other hand, have gone just 4 for 5. Golden State has also missed its final nine threes of the first half – many of which were open looks that just didn’t go down.\n\nNone of this is to knock the Pelicans, who fought back admirably to give themselves a chance in the second half. But it’s clear New Orleans is going to have to clean some things up if it wants to not only be competitive in this game, but win it.\n\nRicky Rubio will remain out for Game 4 of Utah’s Western Conference semifinal series with Houston here in Salt Lake City.\n\nRubio, who hurt his hamstring in Game 6 of Utah’s first-round victory over Oklahoma City, was seen doing some jogging and movement drills after shootaround Friday morning before Game 3, but didn’t look all that close to being able to go full-speed. There was some optimism Rubio might be able to play in Game 4 after he was upgraded to questionable Saturday, but those hopes went away when the Jazz announced about four hours before opening tip that he would not play.\n\nPower forward Derrick Favors, who sprained his ankle in Utah’s blowout loss to Houston in Game 3, remains questionable for Game 4. If he can’t play, Jae Crowder would seem to be the most likely candidate to replace him in the Jazz’s starting lineup.\n\nIf you want to know whether the Warriors can be beaten, there is one stat worth paying attention to: the combined three-point shooting percentage for Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.\n\nWhen Golden State has at least one of Green and Iguodala rolling from three-point range, an already high-powered team is basically unguardable. While Iguodala hasn’t taken a three in either of the last two games, Green is now 7 for 13 after making two in the first quarter Sunday.\n\nWith Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the court, defenses are going to force Green and Iguodala to shoot by default. If at least one of them is taking advantage, it takes the Warriors from being a tough team to stop to one that simply can’t be stopped.\n\nIt’s amazing what happens when a team plays its best lineup to start the game, isn’t it?\n\nGolden State has made six of its first eight shots, including three-pointers from Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, to take a 14-4 lead over New Orleans in the opening minutes of Game 4.\n\nSometimes, this stuff isn’t complicated. Don’t play JaVale McGee, start your best lineup and good things will follow. The Warriors are experiencing that early in Game 4.\n\nRajon Rondo and Draymond Green have had numerous incidents over the first three games of the Golden State Warriors-New Orleans Pelicans series.\n\nWarriors Coach Steve Kerr is fine with Rondo serving his usual role as a professional irritant. What he’s not fine with, though, is Rondo potentially hurting Stephen Curry.\n\n“I don’t see anything wrong with it, other than the tripping,” Steve Kerr told reporters after Saturday’s practice of Rondo’s typical antics. “I’m all for getting underneath a guy’s skin, but you can’t try to step on a guy’s foot or try to swipe a guy underneath his feet while he’s shooting. Those are dangerous plays.”\n\nKerr later said the Warriors were going to alert the league to the plays, but that “it’s not going to do anything.”\n\nThis is what Rondo has done for his entire career, going back to his days as the understudy to Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen with the champion Boston Celtics a decade ago. One of the smartest players in the league, he’s also one of the wiliest competitors in the league, one who knows exactly how to get under the skin of every opponent he’s facing.\n\nHe’s undoubtedly done that to the Warriors thus far — and, in particular, Green, whom Rondo has made a point of going after time and again so far in this series. It has looked like Green might lose his cool a few times and go over the edge, as he did in taking a swipe at San Antonio Spurs forward Davis Bertans in the first round and picking up a flagrant foul point.\n\nRemember: earning four such points results in a suspension. Green and the Warriors know this all too well from two years ago, when Green was suspended for Game 5 of the NBA Finals — a game that allowed the Cleveland Cavaliers to launch their comeback from down three games to one in the series and win the championship.\n\nBut Green, to his credit, has avoided picking up either a flagrant point or a technical so far in this series, despite myriad run-ins with Rondo — including one, at halftime of Game 2, that led to Charles Barkley blurting out, on national television, that he wanted to punch Green in the face.\n\n“I don’t think there’s such thing as crossing the line in basketball. You competing,” Green told reporters Saturday. “So when you competing, you gonna do what you gotta do to win. I never understand when somebody say someone is crossing the line. I said he’s trying to bait me. Yeah, he’s trying to bait me to get a technical foul.\n\n“But at the end of the day, that’s still him trying to win a basketball game. Y’all create these narratives of someone crossing the line. There is no crossing the line to win. You gonna do whatever you gotta do to win.\n\n“I don’t believe in crossed lines. Y’all say I crossed lines. I say I did what I set out to do or I didn’t do what I set out to do.”\n\nRegardless of how Game 4 turns out Sunday, Rondo will be in the middle of everything that happens. He’ll make sure of that.\n\nThe Warriors gave the Pelicans a chance to get into Game 3 of their Western Conference semifinal series Friday night by starting JaVale McGee in place of Andre Iguodala.\n\nWill Steve Kerr make the same mistake twice in Game 4 Sunday afternoon? He isn’t saying before the game, but one would have to think he won’t.\n\nIt is still baffling why Kerr went away from starting small in Game 3, after it had so much success in the first two games of the series. His argument after the game — one he repeated again Saturday to reporters at the team’s practice in New Orleans — is that the Warriors have so many centers that he was trying to buy some minutes with McGee on the court because the team had two games in less than 48 hours.\n\nJust my two cents: I’d personally have avoided the extra 48 minutes that will come with New Orleans facing Golden State in Game 5 back in Oakland — the minimum extra time this series will go after the Pelicans won Game 3.\n\nThe guess here is that Kerr will go with the small lineup of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Iguodala to start Game 4. That will only make it stranger that he didn’t choose to do so at the start of Game 3.\n\nBucks will make Becky Hammon first woman to interview for NBA head coaching job\n\nDonovan Mitchell on dunk vs. Rockets: ‘I just happened to be up there’\n\nDragging these flawed Cavs to the NBA Finals would be LeBron James’s most remarkable feat\n\nCharles Barkley apologizes for saying he wanted to punch Draymond Green in the face\n\nSteph Curry comes off bench to vault Warriors to 2-0 lead; Raptors lost a game they had to win\n\nNBA Podcast: USA Today’s Sam Amick on the West playoffs, what’s next for Paul George and Portland\n\nWhy is there a snake on the Philadelphia 76ers’ court?\n\nImpressive as it was, the Pacers’ Victor Oladipo isn’t satisfied with his breakout season\n\nJohn Wall wants the Wizards to overhaul their roster.

The last time they brought him back he had no brain waves, a damaged brain stem and his heart only beat because of the (adrenaline),\" Reindl wrote on Facebook.\n\nOn a fundraising page for medical expenses, Reindl noted that Trenton's \"kidneys began to fail due to the lack of oxygen after his cardiac arrest.\"\n\nDoctors \"said the next time his heart stopped they had to let him die...or I could sign a paper to donate his organs to save five other kids... so I signed it... I knew he would not hesitate to save 5 more lives,\" the mother wrote on Facebook.\n\nBut Trenton pulled back from the verge in ways his mother insists has defied medical explanation. On March 29, Reindl updated her Facebook page to point out that Trenton, wearing a protective head device, had tossed baskets at the hospital-facility gym.\n\n\"Today for the first time he went to the gym and from his chair in perfect form he made 4 baskets playing basketball,\" she wrote. \"He is now back in the room resting....praise the lord...He is healing every day has his full memory and talks about his school friends every day.\"\n\nWhile Trenton's road to recovery will continue and be full of obstacles, Reindl is fully thankful.\n\n\"God did for my son what he did for his own....and I am so honored to have him back this is my testimony....god is good,\" she wrote.","author":"Bryan Alexander","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T23:39:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56c0251e38ca98b519636ed9d9732383287d94b1/c=28-0-899-492\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636612276023846681-Miracle.PNG","digest":"G4euLMICcYiq+6IOf6zlhg==\n"}

When you see photos from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School prom, you'll know that on that night, they received that moment — but they still didn't allow their missing friends to leave their minds.\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel reported on what organizers aimed to make a magical night, which included a ballroom set up like an enchanted forest complete with real butterflies released from the roof and actors dressed as wood nymphs and other woodland creatures.\n\nAccording to CNN, the attendees only had to pay a fraction of the normal cost of a prom ticket, because the committee received so many in-kind donations. CNN reported that the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort donated the space and the catering, for example. A team of make-up artists and hairstylists also all donated their services in what NBC News reported was called the Beautifully Strong Douglas Prom Makeover Event for any student who was interested.\n\nA huge part of the celebration, of course, was also a tribute to the classmates who lost their lives, CNN reported. With these pictures from the event, you can see a little bit of everything.\n\nMSD senior Sophie Whitney, another student who has stepped to the forefront of the #NeverAgain movement, expressed her pride with a series of photos taken before the prom. A beautiful prom for the Stoneman Douglas students, of course, doesn't change anything in the long run. It doesn't mean that their drive to change America's gun laws will be any easier, that they'll encounter any less resistance, or that it will be any less difficult to move forward with their lives without their lost friends there with them. However, it's still worth taking a night away from everything else to relax, celebrate, and simply remember the people who couldn't be there.","author":"Lani Seelinger","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T21:30:28.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Bustle.com"},"urlToImage":"https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/6/eb51a49c-b094-4b91-b3a2-e630b1179c17-getty-949097250.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=70\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces\u0026fm=jpg","digest":"qa7ZkdK24UvZg3muE5JsSQ==\n"}

Gambino — a.k.a. Donald Glover — turned his appearance on the show into a multi-faceted promotional vehicle, serving as both host and musical guest and appearing in nearly every skit on the show (including a mock-horror sketch about Kanye West’s tweets and another in which a rap trio styled on Migos — who, in another connection, have appeared on Glover’s popular television show “Atlanta” — are in a therapy session.\n\nThe photo of Glover that appeared directly before he performed his new song “Saturday” was clearly styled on the cover of Stevie Wonder’s 1971 album “Music of My Mind,” and that reference was likely no accident: The combines a Caribbean feel with a strong early-‘70s vibe reminiscent of Wonder songs like “Boogie on Reggae Woman” and “Golden Lady.” He was introduced by Zoe Kravitz — Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet’s daughter — who then joined a group of partying people surrounding Glover and his band, who sipped drinks from red plastic cups, danced and played dominos. The song concluded with a heavy percussion breakdown while Glover danced.\n\nLater in the show he performed another new song, “This Is America,” for which he dropped a politically-tinged new video directed by Hiro Murai (who has worked on previous Gambino videos and also directed several episodes of “Atlanta”). Filmed in a large warehouse, the video features a shirtless Glover dancing comically between scenes that alternate between humorous (his dancing and facial expressions) and disturbing (he pulls out an assault rifle and shoots both a hooded captive and, apparently, a gospel choir). In the video’s closing moments, SZA (or someone who looks an awful lot like her) makes an appearance, sitting on a car and looking briefly at the camera.\n\nGlover recently left Glassnote Records for RCA and is expected to release a new album later this year. He will head out on tour in the fall with special guests Rae Sremmurd and Vince Staples; he is also performing at a new installment of his elaborate Pharos festival in New Zealand in November. Glover has said that the next Childish Gambino album he releases will be his last, explaining, “I think endings are good because they force things to get better.”","author":"Jem Aswad, Jem Aswad","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T21:15:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Variety.com"},"urlToImage":"https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/childish-gambino-snl.jpg?w=700\u0026h=393\u0026crop=1","digest":"b48yCkrG7O9fRI97QkXRIA==\n"}

The shooting, which took place in Punjab Province, left Pakistanis on edge as the country prepares to hold general elections as early as July.\n\nAlthough a motive for the shooting has yet to be declared, Mr. Iqbal is a staunch supporter of Pakistan’s religious minorities, often considered heretics by the country’s radicalized offshoots of Sunni Islam. Mr. Iqbal met with religious minorities across Pakistan in recent weeks, encouraging them to go to the polls and promising to provide security to nervous constituents.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Iqbal’s own security detail couldn’t give him the protection he promised religious minorities, who are frequent victims of terrorist attacks as well as harassment and discrimination by the authorities. This past week, the minister met with Hazaras, who practice Shiite Islam, listening to their complaints of widespread discrimination at the hands of the police forces that Mr. Iqbal leads.\n\nMr. Iqbal was shot as he left a meeting and was reportedly shaking hands with a small crowd before getting into his car to depart. The minister may have been meeting with a group of Christians in his constituency of Narowal district according to a Reuters report. Narowal is about 150 miles southeast of Islamabad, the capital.","author":"https://www.nytimes.com/by/maria-abi-habib","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T20:09:01.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/world/07PAKISTAN-assassination/07PAKISTAN-assassination-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"85dx6pFNR2UnspQ/s1Nh9w==\n"}

Johan Els was the only athlete to lift all five stones and did so in a blistering 43 seconds.\n\nEddie Hall was the 2017 World's Strongest Man but was absent from this year's competition and was humble after Bjornsson confirmed his place as his successor:\n\nIn the end, Bjornsson didn't just win his first World's Strongest Man title but sauntered to it in style, demonstrating to the world his might at only 29 years of age.\n\nSunday's result marked a seventh consecutive podium finish at the World's Strongest Man for Bjornsson, but a debut win could herald the coming of a new dominant force in this competition.","author":"Tom Sunderland","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T11:28:29.000Z"},"source":{"id":"bleacher-report","name":"Bleacher Report"},"urlToImage":"https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/740/173/hi-res-8cc42236074e312877bf839b25d2db2b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=1200\u0026q=75","digest":"TZlA9AYa9VikdpdA+DpxYg==\n"}

People are going to wrestle, there, nailed it.","title":"WWE Backlash 2018 live results: Winners and highlights from Sunday night","url":"https://www.sbnation.com/wrestling/2018/5/6/17325404/wwe-backlash-2018-live-results-winners-highlights","text":"Hey, Backlash happened! There were championship matches! Daniel Bryan in a singles match at a pay-per-view! Elias trying to have a concert! Shinsuke Nakamura punching AJ Styles right in the Phenomenal Foreskin!\n\nThis pay-per-view could have had everything, but it sure did not. Want to see what I mean? Below you’ll find the live blog from this event, but be warned: there were lots of rest holds at Backlash.\n\nRoman Reigns would like Samoa Joe to stop saying hurtful but true things to his face. Samoa Joe would like Reigns to stop getting championship matches he can’t do anything productive with. Even though I like Reigns, I’m very much Team Joe here. Beat him down, Joe, Roman needs to do something else for a bit.\n\nSamoa Joe started beating on Reigns before the bell even rang, so apparently that’s how it’s gonna be. Reigns already went through the Spanish announce table! God, I love Samoa Joe. Joe keeps going back to the ring then changing his mind, but now he’s throwing him back into the ring so he can get this thing started in an official capacity.\n\nJoe is, to your surprise, in control once the bell actually rang. Weird how that works. The crowd is super into Joe and super not into Reigns. Again, I like Reigns, but extremely same right now.\n\nRoman got his first bit of offense in, but it stopped in a hurry, as Joe kicked Reigns in the head in the corner to end that uprising as quickly as it began. Samoa Joe suicide dive, damn dude. Reigns went down hard, which, what else are you supposed to do when Joe comes flying at you through the air?\n\n“This is boring” chants from the crowd — I said a couple of hours ago this show needed to stop with so many rest holds, and they did not listen. This match has been Samoa Joe beating the heck out of Reigns and then putting him in a rest hold, rinse repeat.\n\nRoman finally hit a spear, but Joe had a leg on the ropes, so this match continues. This match feels like it’s building to a big Reigns’ comeback, which also feels like a really dumb idea!\n\nJoe avoided getting speared again with a kick he reversed into a Coquina Clutch, which Reigns then reversed into a pin, but now Joe has him in another Clutch with his legs wrapped around Reigns to keep him from moving around with his arm toward the ropes.\n\nReigns is fading until he doesn’t, and he gets the ropes to break the submission. Joe looks like he wants to kill Reigns, which is also what the crowd sounds like. This whole comeback thing for the match does not work when no one wants the comebacker to comeback.\n\nAnd yet, Reigns picks up the win with spear number two. Take it away, Tony.\n\nThis is the “Hey, Bobby Lashley is back!” match on the card, so it’s not a surprise to see it sandwiched between the two mains.\n\nI wish commentary would stop discussing Sami Zayn’s health since he was only storyline injured in order to keep him out of Saudi Arabia, cough cough cough.\n\nI’m realizing now this match exists for a second reason: so Braun Strowman could run at Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn and crash into them at high speeds.\n\nZayn wanted to escape the match, but Owens wanted to stay and fight... so Zayn threw Owens into the ring to fight again. Now Owens is throwing Zayn into the ring to take a beating from Strowman. These two might need to talk things over backstage.\n\nMan, this crowd is dead for Bobby Lashley doing things. Which is unfortunate since Lashley hit the finishing move and got the pin to end it.\n\nWe’re having a no disqualification match between Nakamura and Styles, because Nakamura has been throwing dick punches, incessantly, and the meeting between these last two wrestlers at [redacted] ended in a double count out. This no DQ stip is an elegant solution, one where dick punches are legal!\n\nI’m still afraid to love again after the disappointment that was their WrestleMania 34 match, but heel Nakamura \u003e face Nakamura, so the possibility is there, at least.\n\nThis whole match has been flying around on the outside of the ring, with Nak and Styles taking turns landing blows. Nakamura is in control after throwing Styles into/through the ring steps, but Nak can only get a quick two count when he attempts to pin.\n\nThere is a dueling Nakamura/AJ Styles chant happening, which is mostly making me laugh about the dueling Nakamura/Jinder Mahal chants at SummerSlam.\n\nThis match is moving a little slow, but it feels like it’s building to something. The question is whether it is doing just that, or if it’ll be unfulfilling like Mania’s was. Considering they still haven’t committed to much utilization of the no disqualification stip...\n\nNakamura comes off the second rope with a jumping knee, and then hooks both legs for a pin, but once again gets just the two. Nakamura is finally thinking about weapons, here we go. There’s a chair, and a smile to go with it!\n\nStyles attacks before the chair can be used, but eventually, he eats chair thanks to a reverse exploder suplex.\n\noh shit, Nakamura just ran at Styles to hit him with a Kinshasa, and Styles LAUNCHED a chair into Nakamura that then ricocheted into Styles’ face, which, in a related story, is now bleeding pretty good.\n\nHey this match really picked up right at the moment the chair was introduced, y’all should have listened to me sooner.\n\nNakamura struck first, but Styles finally answered the blow with one of his own now that they’re legal. Also they’re both laying on the ground cupping their beans because obviously.\n\nStyles and Nakamura just kicked each other in the groin as hard as they could, to the point that the match ended when neither could stand up during the ref’s 10 count. Double TKO by low blow, so I guess we’re getting another iteration of this.\n\nI love that this match ended because of simultaneous dick kicks, but I also hate that a no DQ match ended because of a ref counting something besides a pin fall. I’m a land of contrasts.\n\nI’ll be fine with this if the feud escalates into a match where the only legal moves are dick kicks.\n\nI’m going to borrow from my preview for this intro:\n\nThe build to this match has been great, with Carmella all bluster and celebrations while Charlotte quietly stewed until throwing a desk on Mella’s face at the contract signing. Charlotte is going to murder Carmella if someone doesn’t stop her, so... who helps Carmella keep that from happening?\n\nCarmella’s shriek is so wonderful. It’s ear-piercing and terrible but in all the best ways for a heel. She’s already tried to leave this match with the title once, until Charlotte asked her where she was going, with violence.\n\nCarmella keeps booting Charlotte right in the head while screaming about how no one cares about her anymore, but neither are keeping Charlotte down. The chinlock is doing a decent job, at least.\n\nI’m enjoying Carmella screaming “Nobody likes you!” at Charlotte but they need to hit pause on these rest holds.\n\nWell, that’s one way to stop them.\n\nOooh I do not love that finish. Charlotte missed a moonsault and hurt her knee, and then Carmella pinned her in a hurry after a kick to the back of the leg while Charlotte was vulnerable. Carmella really should not have won clean here, not after Charlotte defeated Asuka and ended her winning streak at WrestleMania 34, but I’m also willing to see where this is going.\n\nIt’s not exactly a grudge match, but Cass is mad that Daniel Bryan’s return overshadowed his own, and then he spent time attacking Bryan from behind to make him pay for it.\n\nCass apparently did all of his knee rehab in a tanning booth.\n\nCROWD YOU DO NOT WANT ENZO DO NOT CHANT THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU THINK THAT IT WILL RATTLE CASS OR WHATEVER SINCE THEY USED TO BE TAG PARTNERS BUT ENZO GOT FIRED FOR A REASON, AND THAT REASON WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE POLICE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND LYING TO WWE ABOUT IT\n\nYou morons. Bless everyone who chanted back “No we don’t.”\n\nAnyway, wrestling! Daniel Bryan is running to the corner kicking Cass, as he does, but Cass met him halfway on the last one and threw his ass on the ground. Well, his face, but that’s not an accepted way to phrase things.\n\nCass is heeling it up here, playing to the crowd, and also wasting too much time: Daniel Bryan takes advantage and tries to get the Yes Lock in, but Cass has quite the large frame. Bryan punches Cass in the head until he can lock in his finishing submission and hey, now Bryan is the winner. Neat.\n\nNot an especially memorable match, but Bryan got some big shots in, took down a much larger opponent, and showed he doesn’t need to be in a tag match, and that’s something. Plus, the memorable part might be what just happened now, when Cass attacked during Bryan’s celebration.\n\nThe crowd is chanting “You tapped out” at Cass, so you are forgiven for your previous indiscretion. “You tapped out” is a wonderful chant for taunting.\n\nElias claims to know Bruce Springsteen, who hates New Jersey according to Elias. (This show is in Jersey). He’s dedicating his song to The Boss.\n\nWe don’t get a song because the New Day just interrupted. I haven’t wanted to boo New Day in ages. New Day wants to join the concert — Big E brought a drum, Xavier of course has his trombone, and Kofi has cymbals. Elias is a solo act, though, and Big E definitely made a masturbation joke in response.\n\nAnd now Aiden English interrupts to operatically rap. Hey, it’s a thing.\n\nThis is such a RAW-ass segment in the middle of a pay-per-view, but Rusev is here now, so I’ll allow it.\n\nNo Way Jose and his dance party showed up, and they had Apollo Crews and Titus O’Neil in tow, as well as the Fashion Police. Elias has had enough, and is threatening repercussions for another interruption... which comes immediately in the form of Bobby Roode and a Glorious DDT.\n\nRoode interrupting Elias is a heel move. Well, it is for me, anyway. WWE doesn’t see it that way.\n\nOkay this part was good, though.\n\nI gotta tell y’all, I don’t think I can pretend to be excited for an Orton vs. Jeff Hardy singles match in 2018. I hope I’m wrong and the match teaches me I should be more open-minded, but, I’ve seen matches that Randy Orton isn’t going to win before, and, well, I don’t want to go back there. But I also don’t want Orton to win. What a pickle.\n\nWhat is pretty neat, despite my pessimism, is that this is a battle between Grand Slam Champions, and for a title, even. I’m a sucker for that sort of thing.\n\nJeff Hardy’s shirt has already come off, and now it’s a battle between two guys with a lot of visible tattoos. They have space for so many more tattoos, though, keep painting that canvas guys.\n\nOrton is doing that thing where he’s wasting a lot of time walking around in circles while the announce team talks about how he has no wasted effort in his game. They must do that to me on purpose.\n\nHere’s Orton with purpose himself, slamming Hardy into the barricade three times, and now he’s walking around in circles again with the occasional stomp to break that up.\n\nThe crowd is chanting “Cruiser-weights!” at this match. It is not going great. It’s not even bad so much as it just... is.\n\nJeff Hardy seems to have noticed, and has upped the intensity. He’s throwing himself all around the ring, and Orton has definitely decided to go the other direction and let the crowd boo him for taking too long to do anything. Hardy reverses the RKO attempt before it can get going, and takes down Orton long enough to hit a Swanton Bomb from the top rope. Match over, Hardy defends.\n\nThat’s three championship matches and three successful championship defenses to start the show. [extremely large thinking emoji]\n\nAlexa Bliss is a shitty, shitty friend who said horrible things about Nia Jax and her body before WrestleMania 34, and she paid for it with a loss to her former friend Jax at said event. Now Bliss has decided to tell everyone Jax is a bully and an awful person, because when terrible people try to get sympathy, they do so by blaming others for being the way they are.\n\nBliss gets her rematch against Nia, and hopefully, the result will be the same as it was at Mania: Nia winning, and Alexa in pain because of it.\n\nAlexa is going for Nia’s legs, classic strategy for taking down the larger opponent. Then again, every opponent is larger than the five-foot Alexa, so. It worked, too, as Alexa got Nia off of her feet, and that’s where Jax has stayed. Alexa keeps hitting her in the face, but she made a mistake going for a DDT, and now Nia has her up on her shoulders. Now it’s Alexa on the ground. Whoops.\n\nAlexa is desperate to not let Nia slam her down in any meaningful way. She’s literally just hanging off of her back or her head or her shoulders, at least until Nia just threw Alexa halfway across the ring. No more hanging on, problem solved.\n\nAlexa just pushed NIa off the ropes to the outside, with a bump on the apron on the way down. It did not look great for her wellbeing, and neither did going face-first off the steps there.\n\nBliss keeps trying to make the running crossbody work against Jax, but Nia keeps catching her. Alexa then tried to sunset flip powerbomb Nia in the corner, which... what\n\nTwisted Bliss attempt is caught — Alexa, you gotta stop throwing yourself at Nia — and there’s a Samoan Drop. Nia gets the pin, and retains the RAW Women’s title against Bliss.\n\nHere’s Miz, sans the Miztourage as far as we know, on his way to the ring to face the current Intercontinental Champion, Seth Rollins, who won that title at WrestleMania 34 against Miz. While Miz went to SmackDown and lost the Miztourage (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel), this is a co-branded pay-per-view, as you will be reminded often: those dudes are backstage and can help Miz win a record-tying ninth IC title.\n\nRollins, though, is the man right now, and could probably fight off the Miztourage and Miz at the same time. We’ll see soon enough!\n\nMiz uses the Miztourage to help him get over the edge in close-fought matches, so he’s certainly not helpless without them. He just, you know, isn’t as likely to win. Maybe he’s made some new friends on SmackDown since moving over there.\n\nHe’s doing pretty well for himself here, as he’s been tossing Rollins around and now has him in a chinlock on the ground. Miz is targeting his knee a bit, and Rollins is feeling it. In the bad way, but you knew that. You’re capable of reading context.\n\nRollins is feeling it in the other way now, the good way, as he just crashed into Miz with a suicide dive to the outside, and is now finally in control, even reversing a Skull Crushing Finale into a pin attempt.\n\nMiz knew a stomp was coming to his head, and rolled out of the ring to avoid. He comes back in, and Seth knocks him back out, so here comes another suicide dive aaaand nope, punch to the face.\n\nUh oh, Miz locked in a Figure Four, and Seth’s knee has been targeted as mentioned previously — Seth is struggling, but he’s in the middle of the ring... is Miz going to win the title back oh god not with that look on Rollins’ face, he’s going to reverse this Figure Four... and he did!\n\nA Skull Crushing Finale, and Rollins somehow kicks out again. Rollins is taking a serious beating here: he’s going to have to end this soon if he wants to retain. Rollins hits the Superplex, but his knee gave out before he could hit the Falcon Arrow followup...

The gut-wrenching film made its debut at the end of April, and its box office success cannot be stopped despite its angsty end. And, thanks to one MCU creator, the movie’s final moments just got a whole lot harder to watch.\n\nSo, obviously, major spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War lie below!\n\nThe end of the third Avengers film gives its protagonist what he’s been working towards, and that means bad things for the rest of the universe. Thanos makes good on his promise to snap half the universe from existence after completing the Infinity Gauntlet, and heroes like Spider-Man and Black Panther are turned to ash. In fact, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy are snapped save for Rocket, and James Gunn just told fans what Groot’s final words to the furry hero were.\n\nOver on Twitter, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy answered a fan’s heartbreaking question about that final moment. When asked what Groot’s last line in Avengers: Infinity War was, Gunn said he called the following out to Rocket before turning to ash: “Dad.”\n\nAre you crying? We’re crying. It’s okay, just let it out.\n\nAs fans will recall, Groot’s end came upon the Wakandan field where Earth made its first — and final — stand against Thanos. Rocket and Groot came to join the fray when Thor arrived with his new weapon Stormbreaker. However, no one was a match for Thanos when he appeared with the Time Stone in hand. The Mad Titan procured the Mind Stone in the end, giving him the power to wield the Infinity Gauntlet, and Groot was just one of the billions he killed.\n\nHearing Groot refer to Rocket as dad is tragic for all sorts of reasons, and it makes fans see his actions in Avengers: Infinity War in a different light. When the character shows up in the film, he’s dwelling in teenage adolescence and reveling in his moodiness. He sasses Star-Lord and even gives Rocket the side-eye on occasion, but he still loves his family deep down in his roots. And, now, it looks like Rocket is left on Earth to grieve the loss of his friends, his family, and his son.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is now playing in theaters. Other upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe movies include Ant-Man and the Wasp on July 6th, Captain Marvel opens on March 8, 2019, the fourth Avengers movie on May 3, 2019, the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming on July 5, 2019, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in 2020.\n\nIs your heart broken now that you've learned Groot's final words to Rocket?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5aefd3905a90676be2aa3327"},"description":"UPDATE: 5:40 p.m.","title":"26 Leilani Estates homes destroyed by lava, county officials say","url":"http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/05/06/breaking-news/lava-continues-to-destroy-homes-upend-lives-in-lower-puna/","text":"The toll of destroyed structures continued climbing throughout the day and officials fear that the lava is not finished with the Leilani Estates subdivision.\n\nAs of about 5 p.m., Hawaii County Civil Defense officials had confirmed 30 destroyed structures, most of which are homes. This is up sharply since late Saturday when the toll was at five homes. Civil Defense said lava fissure No. 8, by Luana Street and Leilani Avenue, appears to have done the most damage today.\n\nLeilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, with roughly 700 homes and 1,800 residents, are under mandatory evacuation orders due to the ongoing lava eruption and its dangerous volcanic gases.\n\nResidents were allowed back in temporarily today to retrieve animals, medication, important documents and other essentials. At around 5 p.m., Hawaii island police shut the initial screening point for residents at Highways 130 and 132 but allowed vehicles already in line to proceed to their homes. Residents were instructed to leave immediately after they retrieve their essential belongings and pets.\n\nThe lava eruption began Thursday evening and has been accompanied by heavy seismic activity, including Friday’s magnitude-6.9 earthquake and hundreds of smaller aftershocks.\n\nGeologists say the increased seismic and volcanic activity shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.\n\nOf the increasing toll of destroyed homes, Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said, “That number could change. This is heartbreaking.”\n\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park partially reopened today at 3 p.m. after closing following Friday afternoon’s magnitude-6.9 earthquake and its many aftershocks.\n\n“Our primary objective is the safety of employees, park partners and visitors,” said park Superintendent Cindy Orlando. “The limited opening allows us to respond to new volcanic and seismic events should they occur and the closures that remain are necessary to keep people out of dangerous and unassessed areas. Visitors should expect changing conditions and be prepared for unannounced closures.”\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey has reported about 500 earthquakes in the Kilauea Volcano area since Friday afternoon’s magnitude 6.9, which was centered in Leilani Estates where the lava outbreak is occurring. Frequent small aftershocks continue today.\n\nPark officials said the following areas are open: The Entrance Station from Highway 11 to Jaggar Museum is open from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m.; Jaggar Museum will close at 8 p.m. (the outdoor overlook will remain open until 10 p.m.); Kilauea Visitor Center is open from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m; Sulphur Banks Trail; Steam Vents parking lot; Crater Rim Trail is open from Kilauea Overlook to Jaggar Museum only; the Entrance Station to the 1969 lava flow near Mauna Ulu; Mauna Ulu to Puuhuluhulu (Napau Trail is closed past Puuhuluhulu); Escape Road from Highway 11 to Mauna Ulu; Mauna Loa Road from Highway 11 to the Mauna Loa Lookout and Kipukapuaulu.\n\nAll other park area are closed.\n\nUSGS volcanologist Wendy Stovall told the Associated Press that lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in previous Hawaii eruptions. Lava has spread around 387,500 square feet surrounding the most active fissure, though the rate of movement is slow.\n\nStovall said there is no indication when the lava flow may stop.\n\nHILO \u003e\u003e The number of homes destroyed by lava in Leilani Estates has climbed to 26, from the 21 reported less than two hours ago, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials announced.\n\nAmerican Red Cross officials also said that as of noon today, there were about 250 people at the Pahoa Community Center and 15 people at the Keaau Community Center shelter. About 40 Red Cross volunteers are assisting evacuees, including distributing toiletries, towels, blankets, and snacks, as well as offering mental health and health services.\n\nHawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said this afternoon that sulfur dioxide levels in the Leilani Estates are elevated from this morning.\n\nShe said officials are not sure exactly how many of the estimated 1,800 residents in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions have actually evacuated.\n\n“You’ve got people who are sheltering with their relatives, friends, in their cars. So it’s very hard for us to know how many people actually did evacuate,” she said. There also are people who have stayed in the two subdivisions “for whatever reason,” she said.\n\n“We are urging them to evacuate immediately because of elevated (sulfur dioxide) levels,” Snyder said. “The air quality is very bad.”\n\nA total of 21 homes have been destroyed by the lava eruption in Leilani Estates, Hawaii County officials confirmed this afternoon. The latest update was a sharp increase from the nine homes confirmed earlier today.\n\nThe Hawaii County Fire Department provided the lastest toll after conducting an aerial survey today.\n\nDesite the destruction, Leilani Estates residents are being allowed to return to temporarily to retrieve pets and other essentials. No children are allowed in the area.\n\nGeologists expect the ongoing lava outbreak from Kilauea volcano that is inundating Leilani Estates to continue for days if not weeks to come.\n\nJust before 1 p.m. today, scientists at Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said, “Since late last evening, fissure eruptions have been continuous, and a lava flow has advanced northward about 0.6 miles.”\n\n”Areas downslope of erupting fissures are at risk of lava inundation,” they said. “The general area of Leilani Estates remains at the greatest risk. However, as the eruption progresses, other areas of the lower East Rift Zone may also be at risk.”\n\nThey also warned of the health hazards from high levels of volcanic gas, including sulphur dioxide, and smoke from burning houses and burning asphalt is a health concern and should be avoided.\n\nPAHOA \u003e\u003e The onslaught of lava into Leilani Estates in lower Puna continues into its fourth day with no end in sight.\n\nAs of early this afternoon, the toll of Kilauea volcano’s wrath is nine destroyed houses in the rural subdivision, where at least nine active vents have been confirmed. About 1,800 residents of Leilani Estates and neighboring Lanipuna Gardens remain under evacuation orders.\n\nOvernight, the American Red Cross hosted about 225 people, with roughly 90 pets, at the Pahoa Community Center shelter and 15 people at the Keaau Community Center shelter. The shelters opened soon after the Thursday evening lava outbreaks at Leilani Estates and saw a surge of more evacuees after Friday afternoon’s magnitude-6.9 quake and its hundreds of smaller aftershocks.\n\nThe increased seismic and volcanic activity is expected to continue for days, if not weeks, to come.\n\nLeilani Estates residents are being allowed back in temporarily today, but only to take care of essential tasks, like retrieving or caring for animals, and gathering essential documents and items. Those who return are expected to leave by 6 p.m., Hawaii County officials said.\n\nTraffic backups on Highways 130 and 132 are due to Leilani resident-only screening.\n\nThe upheaval and uncertainty has left the exiled southeastern Big Island residents filled with anxiety. While some residents were initially willing to withstand the lava threat at first, Friday’s 6.9-magnitude quake — the largest in Hawaii in 48 years — scared many to heed the evacuation order.\n\nTesha “Mirah” Montoya, 45, said toxic fumes escaping from the lava vents weren’t enough to make her family evacuate, but the tipping point were the earthquakes.\n\n“I felt like the whole side of our hill was going to explode,” she told the Associated Press. “The earthquake was what made us start running and start throwing guinea pigs and bunnies in the car.”\n\nMontoya, her husband and daughter don’t know how long they will be away from the three-story octagonal house they built nearly 20 years ago from a patch of “raw jungle.”\n\n“My heart and soul’s there,” she said in a phone interview from a cabin on the north side of the Big Island, where the family had hunkered down. “I’m nothing without the land. It’s part of my being.”\n\nCounty officials continue to issue dire warnings to the public about the dangers of the lava and its potentially deadly gases.\n\nThe Hawaii County Fire Department warned residents of “extremely dangerous air quality conditions due to high levels of sulfur dioxide gas in the evacuation area. Elderly, young, and people with compromised respiratory systems are especially vulnerable.” Officials say the high levels detected are an immediate threat to life for anyone exposed, and that “first responders may not be able to come to the aid of residents who refuse to evacuate.”\n\nThe Hawaiian Volcano Observatory confirms that the volcanic eruption continues in Leilani subdivision in lower Puna. Scientists say at least 10 active volcanic vents are on Makamae, Kaupili, Mohala, Kahukai Streets and Pohoiki Road, and two new vents have opened near Makamae and Leilani, and on Kahukai Street, but there is no activity at Puna Geothermal Venture at this time. One of the newest vents erupted about 8:30 p.m. Saturday and was soon sending lava fountains as high as 230 feet, according to U.S. Geological Survey scientists.\n\nGovernment officials are also have notified the public of the following:\n\n\u003e\u003e The Department of Water Supply issued an emergency water restriction for Leilani Estates, Kapoho Beach Lots, Lanipuna Gardens, Pohoiki Bay Estates, Green Lake Farm Lots, Vacationland and all customers on Pohoiki and Kalapana Kapoho Beach Roads. Customers must restrict water use to health and safety needs only, the department said. Water spigots have been installed near the entrance of Lava Tree State Park and a water tanker has been placed in Vacationland for public use, officials said.\n\n\u003e\u003e The U.S. Postal Service said evacuated residents can pick up their mail at the Pahoa Post Office, and that the downtown Hilo Post Office is closed until further notice due to possible structural damage to the Hilo Federal Building at 154 Waianuenue Ave. after Friday’s magnitude-6.9 quake. Downtown’s Post Office box customers can pick up their mail from the will call window at the Hilo Main Post Office at 1299 Kekuanaoa St. from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays, and 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturdays. Customers using this service must present photo identification to pick up their mail.\n\n\u003e\u003e Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea’s summit.\n\n\u003e\u003e The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.\n\nHawaiian Electric Light Co., meanwhile, said power has been interrupted to Leilani Estates due to lava affecting power lines. Company crews are standing by and monitoring the situation, officials said.\n\nHonolulu Star-Advertiser reporters Dan Nakaso, Kevin Dayton and William Cole, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T02:21:19.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Staradvertiser.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/web1__F0Z2110.jpg","digest":"RVuE0ZSBp49DZ0yNxo+JPw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aefd3965a90676be2aa332b"},"description":"What, who is that? Where are we?","title":"Westworld: Making Sense of the Brave New Worlds in “Virtù e Fortuna”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/westworld-season-2-episode-3-who-is-grace-virtu-e-fortuna-recap","text":"Last week’s episode sent Westworld fans skipping and jumping through time in such a dizzying fashion that we decided to break it all down chronologically. This week is a little more straightforward, but we’re sticking with the chronological approach. Hopefully, that will clear a few things up. Alternatively, you can listen to the latest installment of Vanity Fair’s companion podcast, Still Watching: Westworld, where we take a deep dive into the Episode 3.\n\nBut if you’re more of a visual learner, here’s a handy, chronological rundown of the key revelations of “Virtù e Fortuna”—starting, delightfully, in a brave new world.\n\nRaj World—Two Week Ago: Now we know where the hell that Bengal tiger came from. That’s exactly one mystery solved from the Season 2 premiere. An East-Asian-inspired cover of “Seven Nation Army” by the White Stripes kicks us off in an early 20th century-set world. This week’s fun cold open plays out in an entirely different section of the park and takes great pains to orient the viewer in the show’s timeline. Raj World (shall we call it Raj World?) opens with two character we haven’t met before played by Katja Herbers and Neil Jackson as devastatingly attractive guests Grace and Nicholas who take a shine to each other. Why do we have to watch their whole gunplay as foreplay interaction? Well, first of all, this section establishes for the viewer that, yes, we are definitely watching two humans enjoying the fairly problematic pleasures of colonial-era India. Remember that in the original safety rules of the park, guests can’t be hurt by guns. Secondly, we know that when Grace and Nicholas meet, the rules of the park are still in place. By the time they go tiger hunting, the hosts are rebelling.\n\nThat means this entire cold open likely takes place concurrently with the Season 1 finale a.k.a. Robert Ford’s assassination. Bye, Nicholas, we hardly knew ye. Grace, on the other hand, is extremely intriguing. First of all, we know she’s likely not a Host. I mean probably. But she does know an awful lot about the park including an interesting comment about Hosts passing for Guests and where to run when that robot Tiger attacks her. (The show’s creators have said all the animals in the parks are robots except for the flies.)\n\nEver more intriguingly, Grace has a notebook with a curious map inside that she’s very intent on keeping a secret. When we first see her from afar, she’s meeting with someone (a host? another guest?) who appears to tell her something that she writes down in her notebook. But she’s careful to put the book away as soon as Nicholas sits down. Later we see her looking at the map which has an interlocking hexagonal design on it as well as some topographical features. (Note the somewhat corresponding hexagonal design on the electric gate she rushes past when the tiger is after her.)\n\nI have no doubt it’s those hexagons, not any tiger hunt, that brought Grace to Raj World and out into the wilderness. This is not the first nor the last time I’ll compare Westworld to the ABC series Lost, but this introduction of Grace is a classic Lost-ian move. Curious what the tail section of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 was up to this whole time? Here, let us show you. (If you didn’t watch Lost, don’t worry about it.) We’ll wrap up this cold open with confirmation that, yes, that was the same tiger from Episode 1.\n\nAnd, thankfully, Grace survived her dunk in the water with the tiger. It looks like Raj World is just across the pond from Westworld bringing Grace face-to-face with some members of Ghost Nation.\n\nTeam Bernard—Several Days Ago: With one exception, the rest of the episode takes place entirely in chronological order so we’ll save that little flashforward until the end. The Charlotte storyline you need to focus on for now picks up exactly where we left her: with Bernard looking for Dolores’s one-time dad, Peter Abernathy. Remember Abernathy has a bunch of data stored in his head that she needs. We see that Abernathy has been captured by the delightfully mustachioed Host Rebus (Steven Ogg).\n\nWe learn a few things from this little encounter. First of all, it does seem to me that the Hosts are coded to target Guests in formal wear. That’s why Abernathy has been rounded up with the rest of the humans. Or perhaps this is just some of the special coding Sizemore and Charlotte did in order to smuggle him out of the park. Secondly, there’s some kind of official bounty on their heads. Charlotte and Bernard capture the violent Rebus and re-code him to be a kinder, gentler version of himself. (Sadly, if you’ll recall, it’s exactly that kind of chivalry that got Rebus killed on the beach in the present-day plot line in the Season 2 premiere. He was shot trying to protect a female Host.) Some Confederados ride up and capture a confused Abernathy (“Glory, Glory Hallelujah” is a fun choice for Abernathy to sing given all the talk of “glory”) and Bernard while Charlotte callously ditches them on horseback and rides back to find help. Their plotline then merges with. . .\n\nTeam Dolores—Several Days Ago: Dolores, Teddy, Angela, Clementine, and their unlikely ally Major Craddock (you remember the guy they resurrected from the dead last week) ride up to a place called Fort Forlorn Hope. Dolores makes another unlikely ally in the Major’s commanding office: Colonel Brigham (Frederic Lehne). Brigham’s men ride up with Abernathy and Bernard and Dolores gets very tender and concerned seeing her father in such a state. She tries to help him as the Confederados and the rest of her team prepare to face off against the Delos security forces Charlotte is rounding up to fetch Abernathy.\n\nAs Bernard later points out, Abernathy is glitching through all the personalities he’s ever had. (Like father like daughter.) And if you’ll recall from Season 1, one of Abernathy’s former personalities was fond of quoting Shakespeare. That’s where “these violent delights have violent ends” comes from. You can blame both Abernathy and Romeo and Juliet for that. Season 1 was a good time for Romeo and Juliet what with William and Dolores playing star-crossed lovers. This time, Abernathy is (quite appropriately) quoting King Lear. “I am bound / Upon a wheel of fire, / that mine own tears / Do scald like molten lead.” In Lear, the confused, elderly king and father says exactly that to his faithful and ministering daughter Cordelia. Get the parallel? Good.\n\nDolores’s emotions towards Abernathy signal to the viewers that she’s not so awake as to have forgotten all ties to her former life. I suppose we already knew that given her continued affection for Teddy. But this sequence underlines that like Maeve and her daughter, Dolores has robot family ties that bind. She later enlists Bernard to help her fix her father and here is where we learn that, at least right now, Bernard shares no memories with Arnold—the human he’s based on—and has no memories of the world outside the park. And much like last week, we get an intriguing clash of woke host ideology. Then it was Maeve and Dolores. Now, it’s Maeve and Bernard. Last Season, Ford said he had always kept Bernard and Dolores apart because he wasn’t sure how they would interact with each other. Here we see Dolores trying to convince Bernard her way is the right one. Have they woken anything new inside each other?\n\nBut even if Dolores can’t win Bernard to her side, she does convince him to try to help her glitching father. As Bernard has his own difficulties operating (that brain fluid transfusion from Episode 1 seems to be running out), he briefly accesses the incredibly complex code Charlotte has uploaded into Abernathy’s head.\n\nUnfortunately he’s rudely interrupted before he can finish trying to puzzle this out when Charlotte and her Delos security team attack the fort. And here is where Colonel Brigham is going to wish he had read the title of the episode before making an alliance with Dolores. “Virtù e Fortuna” is a reference to a Machiavellian principle on what it takes to achieve victory. Essentially (and don’t get mad as I boil this down, Machiavelli scholars) “fortuna” means chance/luck and “virtù” means strength and the ability to compel objective reality to obey your will. We’ve seen a lot of “virtù” from Maeve this season, but in this episode it’s Dolores going full Machiavelli on the Confederados. As it turns out, she was just using them as a line of defense against the Delos men. Suffice it to say, Craddock is pissed off. In a very Game of Thrones-ish move, Dolores yanks her banner from the wall of the fort as a signal to her men to retreat. They abandon the Confederados to die, but Charlotte and her team still break in the backdoor and steal Abernathy in a scene that prompts us to wonder if Dolores can be killed at all anymore. (She hinted at her own immortality to Bernard earlier in the episode.)\n\nShe takes some bullets in full Terminator mode and here we might want to consult series co-creator Jonathan Nolan on what it takes to kill a Host in Westworld. Last season he said:\n\nSo Dolores takes a licking and keeps on ticking but scores of Confederados did die. Meanwhile, if you’re worried about Teddy’s survival rate after that look she gave him when he wusses out on her order to kill Major Craddock and his men, well, you’re not alone. That’s almost the end of that. But first. . .\n\nTeam Maeve—Several Days Ago : We also pick up with Maeve pretty close to where we left off with her in Episode 2. She’s in the park looking for her daughter in the homestead section with Lee Sizemore and Hector by her side. They are allegedly taking a shortcut, according to Sizemore. But his route forces them to cross paths with Ghost Nation who do not seem care about obeying Maeve’s commands. Hector, who speaks the language, tries to negotiate peace. Maeve, traumatized by memories of Ghost Nation in her homestead storyline, freezes up a bit but eventually manages to escape underground with Hector and Sizemore. And with apologies to Grace in Raj World, here is where we get the most glorious entrance of the week. The platinum-haired Armistice is back from the not-so-dead and torching Delos employees in the underground tunnels. We’ll go ahead and call this a Game of Thrones reference, shall we?\n\nArmistice is not alone. She has Season 1 techs Sylvester and Felix in tow as well as a sweet new robot arm. (Last time we saw her in the Season 1 finale she was down one appendage.)\n\nWe also learn in the tunnels that Sizemore is a crap guide (maybe we can blame Ford’s terraforming) and has no idea where they are. There are some nice additional parallels between Maeve and Dolores in the emotional attachment both women have formed with the men in their lives. Sizemore is baffled by Maeve’s genuine affection for Hector and even more so by his for her which seems organic and in defiance of their programming. (Though not entirely independent because Hector is still reciting Sizemore’s lines.) We also find out, hilariously, that Sizemore programmed Hector as an idealized version of himself. Just chew on that for awhile and then reflect back on that fact that Sizemore struck out with Charlotte in Season 1 right before she made use of Hector as a sexbot back in her room. That’s almost the end of that. But first. . .\n\nTeam Delos—The Present: We hop forward in time to the present where Bernard and Charlotte are reunited perhaps for the first time since she abandoned him to the Confederados. Charlotte looks very suspicious of Bernard and I have to wonder if in the intervening days she’s figured out that he’s not exactly human. Charlotte, Bernard, Stubbs, Strand, and Maling are back at the Mesa a.k.a. HQ and have set up shop underground in one of the abandoned floors. (You can tell by the old Westworld logo on the walls.) Charlotte also reveals that even though she successfully got away with Abernathy after the Battle of Fort Forlorn Hope, she has since lost him again. He’s not in the Mesa and, again, she’s regarding Bernard with a great deal of suspicion. So where is everyone headed from here?\n\nWhat’s Next?: Well it looks like Maeve and her crew are headed to the much-rumored Shogun World. (Actually, it looks like they’re already there.) Sizemore is extremely freaked out by the decapitated Japanese head he finds and Team Maeve closes out the episode staring down a screaming shadowy figure with a blade. The episode wraps up as it opened with a fun Eastern riff on some Western music. This time it’s an Asian wind instrument and the Westworld theme. Team Dolores is not going to be distracted by the loss of Abernathy. Though she’s sending some of her troops to find her father, Dolores tells Teddy they are headed to Sweetwater a.k.a. the place where we saw the train pull up so many times in Season 1.

The same live-voting format was used, with the episode airing live across all time zones in the U.S. The two singers with the lowest votes at the end of the night were eliminated, creating the top five. Judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan provided feedback after the performances but had no actual say in the results. Pop star Nick Jonas mentored the contestants this week, and Prince collaborator and percussionist Sheila E. played with the band.\n\nJurnee kicked things off with her Prince performance, singing \"Kiss.\" She showcased her range and ability to deliver a powerful vocal seamlessly, making it look easy as usual. She worked the stage well, but Perry wanted more on that front. Bryan praised her song choice.\n\nGabby Barrett was up next, singing \"I Hope You Dance\" by Lee Ann Womack, released the year she was born. Jonas bonded with Barrett over both growing up singing in their churches. The song choice suited her, allowing her to sing big and connect with viewers over the emotions of the song. \"Do you know what was wrong with that?\" Richie asked rhetorically. \"Nothing.\"\n\nMichael J. Woodard sang the Prince song \"I Would Die for You,\" and the arrangement was a bit off, throwing him into the song instead of building. But his unique tone brought an edge to the song, and he came out with confidence and infectious energy. Richie said he owned it.\n\nCade Foehner got things rocking with his birth-year song, \"Who Will Save Your Soul,\" by Jewel. It was a different song choice for him, which was the smart choice, since his performances have been consistently strong but also really similar. He showed something a little different but brought the same level of charisma and intensity as he has to all of his performances. The judges thought he struggled in the beginning but brought it together by the end.\n\nFor her birth-year song performance, Catie Turner put her usual twists on Britney Spears' hit \"Oops ... I Did It Again,\" transforming it into a jazzed-up indie tune. It was instantly the most creative performance of the evening, and Turner let her original artistry come through. Perry compared it to Amy Winehouse, and Richie said she's \"bringing a new style to the table.\"\n\nCaleb Lee Hutchinson was up for his birth-year song, singing \"Amazed\" by Lonestar. The judges have repeatedly told Hutchinson he needs to work on his stage movement, and Jonas gave him some pointers. The song choice wasn't that exciting, but it suited his tone, and he did seem more confident in how he moved around the stage than usual. The judges still thought he needed work, though. They didn't really have anything positive to say, but they didn't tear him down, either.\n\nMaddie Poppe sang the Prince rendition of \"Nothing Compares to U\" and played piano for her first performance. She brought the full package, delivering a compelling lyrical interpretation and connecting with the emotions of the song while also delivering on the technical vocal front. It was an understated performance, but she shined with perfect singing. Perry said she would buy tickets to her show. Bryan said the performance was \"mesmerizing.\"\n\nWoodard was up again for his birth-year song, choosing \"My Heart Will Go On,\" by Celine Dion. This was the bolder song choice for him, and he knocked it out of the park. He delivered some huge notes and gave a theatrical, moving performance that was instantly magnetic. Richie and Bryan both commended his stage presence.\n\nFor his Prince selection, Foehner returned to sing \"Jungle Love.\" This was more in his vocal wheelhouse than the first performance, and he put a lot of grit and funk behind his singing. His energy level was high, and his personality came through. It was a standout rock performance, and the judges were more excited about it than his first.\n\nBarrett returned to sing Prince's \"How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?\" bringing some of her gospel background to it and going for some big notes that really showcased her range and power. Perry said she thinks she is \"the most ready to go on tour,\" and Bryan called it a \"mic-drop moment.\"\n\nFor her second performance, Jurnee sang \"Back at One\" by Brian McKnight, explaining that it was her parents' wedding song. Despite the emotional connection, it wasn't the most exciting song choice, but Jurnee sang it well as always, her ad libs and phrasing solid. Bryan praised her runs.\n\nTurner came back to sing \"Manic Monday,\" a Bangles song that was written by Prince. She ended up forgetting her lyrics and then struggling to recover from the mistake. Her voice sounded good, but she never really found her groove. The judges didn't seem to mind, though, praising her ability to recover and noting that things don't always go perfectly.\n\nPoppe's second performance was Sheryl Crow's \"If It Makes You Happy,\" accompanying herself on the guitar. It wasn't as original of a cover as her first performance, but it was still solid, and Poppe came off as a well rounded, versatile artist. Perry said she holds her own every time she plays an instrument. The judges were all impressed by her multi-instrument skills.\n\nHutchinson closed out the performances by singing \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince, appearing even more comfortable on stage and delivering a smooth, soulful performance that finally delighted the judges. Perry said she was proud.\n\nThen it was time for results. After the nationwide vote, Hutchinson, Poppe, Foehner, Barrett and Woodard were voted through to the top five. Jurnee and Turner went home.","author":"Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T02:11:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Hollywoodreporter.com"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/04/148442_0053_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg","digest":"nMWRZj/pCno0NGzf8MAuxQ==\n"}

Giuliani on Sunday said Trump still has confidence in him and believes the media blitz “all worked out.”\n\n“I’ll give you the conclusion: We all feel pretty good that we’ve got everything kind of straightened out and we’re setting the agenda,” Giuliani, the former New York mayor who recently joined Trump’s legal team, said in an interview with The Washington Post. Giuliani said he met with the president at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., to discuss developments and legal strategy.\n\n“Everybody’s reacting to us now, and I feel good about that because that’s what I came in to do,” he said.\n\n“We’ve made a deal this weekend: He stays focused on North Korea, Iran and China, and we stay focused on the case and we’ll bother him when we have to,” Giuliani said of his meeting with Trump.\n\nSince last week, Giuliani has made various assertions about the $130,000 that Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen paid to Stormy Daniels, an adult-film star who said she had a relationship with Trump a decade before he won the presidency. On Friday, after Trump said that Giuliani needs to “get his facts straight” about the payment, Giuliani appeared to walk back some of his comments, saying he was still learning the facts of the case. Trump and White House officials have also weighed in on the payment.\n\nAnd after all of these media appearances and statements, the only thing that is clear is how little has been cleared up.\n\n[Giuliani says Trump doesn’t have to comply with a Mueller subpoena and could invoke the Fifth Amendment]\n\nGiuliani began his media blitz last week on Fox News by saying that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels in 2016 in exchange for her silence. More interviews — and more claims — soon followed. Giuliani told The Post that Trump repaid Cohen in 2017, which would predate Trump’s assertion last month that he did not know about the Daniels payment or where Cohen got the money. During one of his follow-up appearances on Fox, Giuliani also seemed to link the payment to the looming 2016 election.\n\n“My issue is getting up to speed on the facts here,” Giuliani told George Stephanopoulos during an interview Sunday on ABC News’s “This Week.” “I’m about halfway there.”\n\nGiuliani’s freewheeling remarks in the ABC interview included commenting that it was possible Cohen paid off other women, assailing the special counsel probe investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, comparing former FBI director James B. Comey to Judas and calling Daniels “opportunistic.”\n\nIn a statement Friday, Giuliani said that Cohen’s payment was made to resolve a “personal and false allegation” rather than protect Trump’s campaign on the eve of the election.\n\n[Giuliani says it is possible Michael Cohen paid off other women for Trump]\n\nGiuliani’s comments on Sunday were notable for how much he said he still did not know on his fifth consecutive day of media interviews. During his ABC interview, Giuliani said that he did not know when Trump learned about the payment, when Trump discovered Daniels would take money to remain quiet about her allegations and why Trump publicly denied knowing about a payment for which he had already reimbursed Cohen.\n\nWhen asked by The Post if he was confident that Trump had no knowledge of the payments to Daniels during the campaign, Giuliani declined to directly answer, instead repeating his argument that no campaign finance laws were broken.\n\n“The critical thing is, it wasn’t a campaign finance violation,” he said. “It was a personal thing, not something that should be looked at by a prosecutor.”\n\nKathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an expert in legal ethics, said Giuliani’s interview Sunday reminded her of a garden hose that was whipping around wildly because nobody had a handle on it yet: “Just erratic, unpredictable, aimless.”\n\nStill, she said, the appearances also made her wonder what Giuliani’s goals were on television and whether he understood campaign finance law.\n\n“When he starts on a matter and the matter’s ongoing and he needs to get up to speed, yes, there’s risk involved in making any statement,” she said. “But what’s even more striking to me is, I couldn’t tell what he thought he was going to accomplish.”\n\n[Giuliani tries to clarify comments on Trump’s reimbursement of Stormy Daniels payment]\n\nExperts have said the timing of the Daniels payment raises possible campaign finance issues, as does the fact that it was never revealed in financial disclosure forms. A watchdog group has filed complaints about the transaction with the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department.\n\nMichael Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, appeared on “This Week” after Giuliani and sharply dismissed the former mayor’s claim that the payment had nothing to do with the campaign.\n\n“This guy’s all over the map over the last 72 hours on some very simple facts that should be very straightforward,” Avenatti said. “I think it is obvious . . . to the American people that this is a coverup, that they are making it up as they go along. They don’t know what to say because they’ve lost track of the truth.”\n\nGiuliani also said Sunday that Cohen is no longer Trump’s attorney. Cohen did not respond to a message on Sunday regarding that claim or whether he had made payments to other women.\n\nTrump, who has denied the affair, told reporters aboard Air Force One last month that he did not know about the payment to Daniels or where Cohen got the money to make the payment. After Giuliani said Trump reimbursed Cohen, the president’s Twitter account posted a statement saying Cohen was repaid through a monthly retainer.\n\nTrump was asked Friday about his contrasting statements, and he denied changing his story, telling reporters to “take a look at what I said” in his remarks aboard Air Force One. He did not elaborate.\n\n[Federal judge says Mueller’s team wants Manafort to “sing” about Trump]\n\nOn Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump’s comments on Air Force One were actually him saying he did not know about the payment when it was made.\n\n“I’m going to relay to you what the president has told me, which is the best I can do,” Conway said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I asked the president what he meant. And he said, ‘I didn’t know about it when the payment occurred.’ ”\n\nConway denied that the White House has a problem with credibility, saying of Trump’s remarks: “He spoke honestly. He said no, which refers to when the payment occurred.”\n\nThe Post’s Fact Checker has analyzed Trump’s public statements since he took office and has found that, so far, he has made more than 3,000 false or misleading claims, an average of nearly 6.5 such claims per day.\n\nIn his interviews Sunday with The Post and ABC News, Giuliani made multiple unprompted criticisms of Daniels for her appearance the night before on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nHe also repeatedly sought to highlight on Sunday the comments made by T.S. Ellis III, a federal judge who last week sharply questioned the special counsel’s fraud case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Ellis said that the special counsel’s team is only interested in getting information on Trump that could “lead to his prosecution or impeachment.”\n\nGiuliani called the judge’s comments a “pretty serious blow,” and he added in reference to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III: “I feel bad for Bobby.”\n\nDuring his ABC interview, Giuliani insisted that Trump would not have to comply if Mueller subpoenas the president . He also suggested that it was possible Trump could invoke the Fifth Amendment if he sat down with Mueller’s team, which is seeking to interview the president.\n\n“We don’t have to” comply with a subpoena, Giuliani said, a situation that could make its way to the Supreme Court if it is not resolved. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.”\n\nGiuliani told The Post that Ellis’s remarks “probably makes it much more defensible for [the president] not to be interviewed.”","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T23:23:47.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/toPH5ds658EtNTI6bDdr9br3IFk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3BGWFESROII6RJKRLNSIVPRJ54.jpg","digest":"tqD7qPYJ41p9tzrjcRFRMg==\n"}

According to witnesses, the actor didn’t think twice about stopping his show completely to help her.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which first reported the incident, a woman began having a seizure in the third row. At first the “Hangover” star, who was performing live at the time, thought he was being heckled but quickly realized the situation was far more serious than that. He reportedly cleared the area and monitored her until paramedics arrived. An audience member who happened to be an EMT reportedly also stayed with the woman until things were under control.\n\nAfter that, Jeong reportedly stepped right back up on stage and continued his set and got the room laughing again. Before leaving with paramedics, the woman in question was reportedly back on her feet and able to walk.\n\nIf one has to require medical attention during a live show, Jeong’s show is a safe bet as the actor began his career as a real-life doctor. After graduating Duke University in 1990, Jeong earned a medical degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine five years later.\n\nAlthough he no longer practices, he’s a licensed physician in the state of California. Still, thanks to his breakout role in “The Hangover” and the TV show “Community,” Jeong has pursued acting for several years. Still, he proved on Saturday he’s still got his medical chops.\n\nReps for Jeong did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.","author":"Tyler McCarthy","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T22:50:41.000Z"},"source":{"id":"fox-news","name":"Fox News"},"urlToImage":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/2018/05/06/ken-jeong-stopped-live-show-to-provide-medical-attention-to-audience-member/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1525646927397.jpg?ve=1","digest":"l+78PDrBAZ7yOFB6kz+w6g==\n"}

Steve Stivers, who heads the party's campaign arm in the House.\n\nThe risks are plain for Republicans in the state that is home to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: Democrats dominate California politics, and midterm elections generally favor the party not in control of the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump lost the state by more than 4 million votes in 2016.\n\nPolitical observers say recent Democratic victories in Pennsylvania and Alabama, and House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire at the end of the term makes likelier the prospect of Democrats gaining the 23 seats needed to take control of the chamber.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","author":"Bradford Betz","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T06:17:55.000Z"},"source":{"id":"fox-news","name":"Fox News"},"urlToImage":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2018/05/06/californias-orange-county-may-play-key-midterm-election-role/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1525587322687.jpg?ve=1","digest":"kKp8aMByl75HN+3lwKwb0w==\n"}

They named the suspected shooter as Abid Hussain, 21, and said they had found him carrying a pistol.\n\nAfter being rushed to a nearby hospital, Iqbal was taken by helicopter to Lahore, capital of Punjab.\n\n“The minister luckily survived,” said junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry. “Thank God, he is out of danger.”\n\nBlasphemy is a deeply emotional and politically charged issue in Pakistan, even more so since Labaik has emerged in the past year.\n\nThe party was born out of a protest movement supporting Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard of the governor of Punjab who gunned down his boss in 2011 over his call to relax Pakistan’s draconian blasphemy laws.\n\nLabaik has been gaining strength with an election platform centred on punishing blasphemy.\n\nMany of its supporters say PML-N, despite repeated denials, wants to ease the blasphemy laws. While dozens are on death row for blasphemy, no one has been executed in recent decades.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday night, Labaik leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi condemned the attack on Iqbal and said the party had not authorised any of its supporters to take up arms.\n\n“Tehreek-e-Labaik is an unarmed struggle to bring the Prophet’s religion to the throne,” Rizvi said.\n\nThe statement did not specifically mention any suspect in custody or any links to the party.\n\nTehreek-e-Labaik, whose name means Movement of the Prophet’s Followers, is a political grouping with no known links to the various Islamist militants - including the Pakistani Taliban - that have carried out bombings and other attacks in Pakistan.\n\nIqbal, who also heads the planning ministry, has in recent years overseen the implementation of Chinese-funded Belt and Road infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of the near $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nPrime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack on Iqbal and called for an immediate police report.\n\nA senior government official, who declined to be named, said early information suggested Iqbal had been returning from a meeting with a Christian group.\n\n“We are not sure whether it has got anything to do with the motive. We will know only after investigation of the attacker.”\n\nMilitant attacks in Pakistan have fallen sharply over the past few years, but Islamist fighters continue to pose a threat and carry out assassinations.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2013 elections, which PML-N won handsomely, Pakistani Taliban militants killed more than 70 people in attacks targeting the Awami National Party (ANP), the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). Many of their most prominent candidates were prevented from campaigning openly.","author":"Mubasher Bukhari","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T02:56:59.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180507\u0026t=2\u0026i=1259236370\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE46040","digest":"0Mh4BFmSQ6ILvEKCoNvd3Q==\n"}

The strike could cause a major slow down at the school’s hospitals this week.\n\nThe labor action includes three unions in the university system — which altogether represent approximately 53,000 employees — but the movement is led by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299. That union works on behalf of service workers who operate as security guards, custodians, truck drivers, gardeners as well as technical workers such as respiratory therapists, nursing aides, surgical technicians and more.\n\n“The big picture here is that there’s growing inequality at the University of California, and we’re going out because they have not even attempted to address it,” AFSCME Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger told NBC News.\n\nThe union cites growing income disparity, higher healthcare premiums, outsourcing of low-paying service worker jobs and an internal union research document that they say proves that women and minorities at the university are regularly paid less than white men.\n\nThe university denies the allegations, stating said that it “cannot justify to taxpayers such an excessive raise” as the one that AFSCME is demanding. The two parties have been negotiating for more than a year, and last month the school chose to give workers a 2 percent raise without the consent of the union.\n\nThe unions say the raise is not enough, as it does not change the growing inequality between service workers at the bottom and the school’s top administrators, and they still plan to walk off the job on Monday.\n\nA UC spokesperson said that this action won’t change anything and may only serve to harm those who participate.\n\n“A strike is only hurting the union’s own members who will lose pay for joining this ill-advised three-day walkout, while negatively affecting services to patients and students,\" the spokesperson said. “A disruptive demonstration will change neither UC’s economic situation nor the university’s position on AFSCME’s unreasonable demands.”\n\nThe University of California attempted to stop approximately 700 workers from participating in the strike via a court order last week, but a California court denied their request.\n\nThe state school system took another hit when two unions chose to strike with AFSCME Local 3299: University Professional and Technical Employees and California Nurses Association. Their addition meant tens of thousands of more people standing at the picket line and greater disruption in the university system.\n\n“Numbers, solidarity and speaking in unity really amplifies the urgency and the seriousness of what we’re talking about at the university,” Lybarger said.\n\nThe California Nurses Association said they strongly support the union’s efforts.\n\n“Nurses work side by side with them every day, said Benjamin Elliott, a California Nurses Association union representative for the northern part of the state. “When AFSCME called a strike, the nurses voted whether or not to go on sympathy strike with them. Ninety-eight percent of nurses voted to go on that strike with them in support of their issues.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how much of an effect this will have on day-to-day operations, but NBC San Diego reported that the impending strike has forced two UC hospitals in San Diego to postpone all non-emergency procedures.\n\n\"UC is doing everything in its power to limit the strike’s impact on our campuses and medical centers, while working hard to ensure patients and students receive the services they deserve,\" a UC spokesperson said, adding that individual campuses and medical centers would have more information about their individual contingency plans.\n\nThe three unions said they have organized a so-called \"patient protection task force\" who would be \"ready to respond in any emergency life threatening\" scenarios.\n\n\"Our members really feel a responsibility for the work they do every day,\" said Lybarger. \"Striking for us is a measure of last resort because we work for the public and the public’s health and safety is a top priority for our workers.\"","author":"Phil McCausland","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T00:40:19.000Z"},"source":{"id":"nbc-news","name":"NBC News"},"urlToImage":"https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_18/2422736/180506-uc-hospitals-strike-se-105p_7d166b5e566eaded7e829861b37c7627.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg","digest":"PaOMORtEQwWAle60LA1Htw==\n"}

With this episode’s theme being Prince songs and birth year songs (the contestants will sing two songs each), it’s sure to feature an eclectic set of selections from the talented hopefuls. Let’s follow along with host Ryan Seacrest and entertaining judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan as we witness more thrilling performances during our recap here!\n\nTonight the contestants are coached by none other than Nick Jonas and they’re ready to show us what they’ve learned. The night starts with a look back at Prince’s amazing career as the hopefuls get ready to sing some of his biggest hits. Jurnee kicks things off with the very popular song “Kiss” and she’s definitely working it! Her vocals sound so smooth as she sings and struts her stuff on stage in purple (Prince’s iconic color) thigh-high boots. Drummer Sheila E, who regularly performed with Prince, is helping everyone out with their Prince songs tonight and she’s killing it in the Jurnee performance. After the memorable moment, Katy says she likes how Jurnee moved around during the song and Luke likes the song choice.\n\nGabby Barrett is next and she’s the first up for a birth year song. She was born in 2000 and sings “I Hope You Dance” by Lee Ann Womack, which was a big hit that year. She belts out the lyrics with confidence and a lot of emotion. Katy tells her she previously thought she’s seen a few Gabbys but tonight she realizes there’s only one Gabby. Lionel tells her there was nothing wrong with her performance and thinks she’s fantastic.\n\nMichael J. Woodard brings us back to Prince’s music next and sings “I Would Die 4 U” with a lot of enthusiasm and strong vocals. The judges give him a standing ovation. Luke tells him they see him growing and advises him not to be scared to dance and cut loose. Lionel thinks he owned the song and tells him the sky’s the limit if he works on relaxing. Katy thinks the lyrics explained his story and she tells him she’s living for him.\n\nCade Foehner is the oldest remaining contestant born in 1996 and he sings Jewel‘s “Who Will Save Your Soul” for his birth year song. He puts a totally different spin on the classic tune and makes it all his own with a true rock sound. Lionel tells him he keeps pushing the envelope with every performance and he’s very proud of him for his rendition of the song. Katy jokes that she thinks her mom, who is in the audience, is on her phone voting for him because she’s obsessed with him. Luke lets him know he always finds his zone even if the songs he sings are out of his wheelhouse.\n\nCatie Turner has a serious fan girl moment when she meets Nick for her coaching but she somehow manages to get through the session. She then takes the stage to sing her birth year song: “Oops!… I Did It Again” by Britney Spears from 2000. Her performance is full of spunk and has a jazzy vibe that reflects her huge addicting personality. Katy compares her vocals to Amy Winehouse and Luke tells her to make sure she tells herself that she’s a star. Lionel advises her that although she believes she’s not yet all the way there, she needs to start believing that she has what it takes because she totally made Britney’s song her own.\n\nCaleb Lee Hutchinson, who was born in 1999, is next. After Nick teaches him how to do a natural stage walk, he is ready to perform. He sings “Amazed” by Lonestar and has powerful vocals and a sweet smile  Luke commends him for admitting he hasn’t been comfortable on stage while Lionel teases him about the girls screaming while he’s on stage. He tells him to not think about what he’s doing and just be natural. Katy loves the song and admires how he can still perform after initially “flopping around” and being nervous.\n\nMaddie Poppie takes the stage for the Prince theme next. She sings “Nothing Compares to You” by Sinead O’ Connor, which was written by Prince, while playing piano. Her crooning vocals and strong stage presence helps her set a true mesmerizing vibe. Katy tells her that even if she doesn’t win the competition she’s still going to her concert and Luke is speechless but gives his best country encouragement by telling her she did good.\n\nMichael is back with his birth year song this time. He takes on the hugely popular “My Heart Will Go On” by Celine Dion from 1997. His intense vocal range and heartfelt demeanor helps him to stand out and sing from somewhere deep inside. Katy compares his talent to former American Idol alum Jennifer Hudson and thinks he could win an Oscar or Grammy. Luke tells him he has a way of making sure no one can look away when he’s on stage and Lionel agrees while telling him to know how good he really is.\n\nRyan breaks the news that all seven contestants will be hitting the road on the American Idol tour when the show is done. After enthusiastic celebratory hugs, Cade goes out on stage to sing his Prince song, “Jungle Love” and absolutely kills it. He looks comfortable throughout the performance and sets his mark while playing electric guitar. Luke tells him he made the song his own and they’re there to find people like him. Lionel agrees and Katy can’t help but fan herself as she jokes she doesn’t know what’s come over her since she could be his babysitter.\n\nGabby takes on Prince next with “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore” and totally owns the stage. Her sultry style and strong vocal range helps her completely blow the judges away. Lionel tells her that was complete ownership and Katy thinks she’s the most ready to go on tour. Luke thinks it was a mic drop moment and congratulates her on being a big star.\n\nJurnee was born in 1999 and she chooses to sing her parents’ wedding song “Back At One” by Brian McKnight. Her rendition of the ballad gives off a dreamlike feel and she stretches her vocals with passion and power. Katy thinks it was really cool and although Jurnee’s version of the song wasn’t her favorite she knows she has the ability to give people a lot of feeling when she sings. Lionel admires how calm she was throughout the song and tells her she already won because she’s going on tour.\n\nCatie is back with the Prince-written song, “Manic Monday” by The Bangles. She has a rough start when she forgets the lyrics but quickly picks back up after a little laugh at herself. With a colorful stage and a lot of energy she looks like she’s having fun and gives it her best. Luke tells her that she has yet to make any kind of mess up in the competition so the little glitch she had tonight is okay. After Catie comments that it’s just not her night, Katy quickly corrects her and says it is her night. Lionel tells her the music industry is not perfect and when that kind of stuff happens, it’s all about recovery which she did a fantastic job at.\n\nMaddie is ready for her birth year song, “If It Makes You Happy” by Sheryl Crow from 1997. She takes the stage with a smile and gives it her all while playing an electric guitar. There’s a lot of feeling in her voice and a lot of passion. Lionel tells her she can be anybody right now and reminds her no matter what happens in the competition she has a future in the business. Katy tells her she holds her own every time she picks up an instrument and Luke expresses that she’s come a long way.\n\nCaleb gets to sing the last song of the night and it’s Prince’s memorable, “When Doves Cry”. His haunting rendition includes his guitar playing and has a lot of soul along with his recognizable twang. He finishes strong. Katy is so proud of him and thinks it was a great rendition. Luke agrees and Lionel mirrors Katy’s sentiment by also saying he’s proud of him.\n\nIt’s time to count the votes and pick the Top 5, who will go onto Nashville and work with American Idol alum and country superstar Carrie Underwood. And, the top 5 are… Caleb, Maddie, Cade, Gabby and Michael J! That means that Catie and Jurnee sadly have to go home. What an incredible night with amazing performers!","author":"Erin Silvia","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T00:31:35.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Hollywoodlife.com"},"urlToImage":"https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/american-idol-top-5-recap-ftr.jpg","digest":"lTx/cXjTMULnW471dDdCCQ==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5aeffc115a90676be2aa33ad"},"description":"With Democrats predicted to take back the House in November, NPR's Michel Martin talks Republican midterm strategy with Jesse Hunt, press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee.","title":"Republican Midterm Election Strategy","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/06/608942080/republican-midterm-election-strategy","text":"We're going to start the program today with a look at national politics as the primary season kicks off in earnest. Four states are holding primaries on Tuesday. So we thought this was a good time to check in on how Republicans and Democrats are seeing their respective strategies ahead of the November midterms. By now, you've certainly heard many pollsters predict that Democrats will retake control of the House of Representatives. We'll hear from a Democrat in a few minutes. But first, Republican Jesse Hunt is with us. He's the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Their job is to elect as many Republicans as possible to the House. He was kind of to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Jesse Hunt, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nJESSE HUNT: Thanks for having me.\n\nMARTIN: Do you see an overall message taking shape for Republicans this year?\n\nHUNT: I do. I think Republicans are rallying around what is one of our top achievements this Congress which is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is something that I think has benefited the vast majority of Americans, helped companies give more money back to their employees, helped put more money in people's paychecks. But what you're also seeing was unemployment sink to the lowest level since 2000, 3.9 percent. We finally broke that 4 percent barrier. I think that's a very strong indication of how well the economy is doing, and it's something that Republicans will be able to take to their voters and show that Republican leadership in Washington is really benefiting the American people.\n\nMARTIN: You know, it's interesting that earlier this week - or rather, last week, Marco Rubio had some harsh words about the tax bill, the senator from Florida. He said, there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker, and the tax bill wasn't enough to pull, say, the Republican candidate over the line in Pennsylvania in a special election that was held a couple of weeks ago. So is that evidence that the numbers may be strong but that it isn't being experienced at the voter level?\n\nHUNT: First of all, that's the senator's opinion, which, you know, I'll disagree with. And I think Pennsylvania is a very unique - was a very unique case. That was a case of where you had one candidate on the Democrat side who, you know, was well-funded, was able to spend more money than a Republican candidate who wasn't quite as strong. There was a lot of unique factors there in the special election. But I think overwhelmingly what you're seeing is positive economic indicators, be it consumer confidence, wage growth, job creation. In cases where you have Republican incumbents that have actually voted for this piece of legislation, they will be able to go and talk to their constituents and tell them exactly what they're doing, exactly how they're trying to help ease the cost of living and put more money in their pockets.\n\nMARTIN: What we are seeing though is a lot of ads around the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi. We're seeing a tremendous number of ads. In fact, I think one of our colleagues did a count to say that there were more ads about Nancy Pelosi than there were about the tax bill. Why is that?\n\nHUNT: Well, as you saw this week, Nancy Pelosi confirmed what we knew in a conversation with The Boston Globe that if Democrats are able to regain control of the House, she is going to run for speaker. And part of her plan to set an agenda, if she were speaker, involves undoing the GOP tax plan. That's something that both her, Steny Hoyer and Joe Crowley have all said that they plan to do as a way of rallying Democrats around a message. That's their overall objective. So what you are seeing is Nancy Pelosi featured mainly because she is the most-unpopular politician in America.\n\nMARTIN: And on the other side of that, as you know, that President Trump is deeply unpopular with Democrats. We see from the polling that he retains support among a majority of Republicans. But in the November election, Republicans have to face Democrats. And he is considered to be a major factor not just in Democratic enthusiasm but also in Democratic fundraising. Should the president be campaigning with candidates? Should we expect to see him campaigning with candidates?\n\nHUNT: That's on each individual candidate and campaign. No district is the same as another. You know, a district in Minnesota is not the same as a district in South Florida. So it will depend on the candidate, the campaign, their strategies to determine to what extent they want to involve the president.\n\nMARTIN: Do you acknowledge an enthusiasm gap?\n\nHUNT: Certainly some of the actions or things the president has done has certainly angered a lot of the Democratic base, some of the progressive wing, the resistance, if you will. That has, quite frankly, actually hijacked the Democratic Party. And so instead of moderating, moving to the middle, they're just going farther to the left. So they do have energy. That is very real. And we are working to contend with that.\n\nMARTIN: That was Jesse Hunt, press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Their job is to help elect as many Republicans as possible.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Despite three new wide openings led by “Overboard,” the Marvel film comprised more than two thirds of all ticket sales. It looks like we’re back to the feast-or-famine trend, especially with “Deadpool 2” in two weeks and “Solo: A Star Wars Story” right after.\n\nIf the feasts like “Black Panther” and “Infinity War” keep performing, exhibitors will be happy for the short term. Those two Marvel titles took No. 1 for seven weeks so far in 2018, and have a domestic take to date over $1.1 billion. “A Quiet Place” is a very distant if impressive third, but in the top titles of 2018 it takes nos. 3-15 to equal those two Marvel movies.\n\n“Avengers: Infinity War” has now made $450 million domestic in 10 days. Internationally it’s $713 million, with China still to come, for a combined total of $1.164 billion. By the end of next week, it should surpass all other films worldwide since “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” And depending on China, it could be the first since that smash to reach $2 billion.\n\nDomestically, it’s now $47 million ahead of “Panther” at 10 days (that film dropped 45 percent in its second weekend. “The Avengers” reached $420 million (adjusted) and dropped 50 percent. At this point, it looks like “Infinity War” should have a domestic total between $625 million-$700 million, most likely over $650 million.\n\nAll that said, overall grosses dropped about 15 percent ($30 million) from the same weekend last year. (Last year had “Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.”) Three new, somewhat offbeat titles tried their luck, with one initial success in “Overboard,” and two failures in “Tully” and “Bad Samaritan.”\n\n“Overboard,” from Lionsgate’s Pantelion (along with MGM) is the newest English-language film starring comic Eugenio Derbez. Costarring Anna Faris, it is a remake of the 1987 Garry Marshall comedy with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. It retains the story of the original with a gender switch: Derbez plays a wealthy yacht owner who falls and loses his memory, with a cleaning woman taking advantage of the situation to pose as his wife.\n\nIt’s the best opening so far for a Derbez-lead film. The mostly Spanish “Instructions Not Included” opened to over $8 million in 2013, while the bilingual “How to Be a Latin Lover” last year started at over $12 million. This had an impressive 23 percent Saturday increase from its opening number, validating its positive A- Cinemascore.\n\nDespite positive reviews for “Tully” and the pedigree of Jason Reitman as director and Charlize Theron as a flailing mother, the comedy failed to gain traction at 1,353 theaters and grossed only $3.1 million. Reitman has struggled in recent years: “Juno” made $184 million in 2007 and in 2009, “Up in the Air” made $100 million. Since then, he’s been mired below $20 million.\n\nQuirky (which this is) can be tricky, as initially unsympathetic characters (Reitman’s increasing focus). It’s his third time with “Juno” writer Diablo Cody, but failed to generate similar interest. Focus chose a wide release over platform. The right move? It is increasingly the new normal; staggered releases seem reserved for guaranteed name directors who can generate sustained interest outside awards season. Here, Focus bet on reviews and counterprogramming for adults. The reality is that a film like this, whatever its release pattern, is increasingly tricky to release in theaters.\n\nThe other new wide release, horror thriller “Bad Samaritan” from “Geostorm” director and longtime Roland Emmerich producer Dean Devlin, was released via his production company. With the date, it managed to get over 2,000 theaters and a possible top 10 placement (final figures tomorrow needed to confirm). It also managed an average of under 100 ticket buyers per theater. Foreign presales and other non-domestic theatrical revenues will determine its fate.\n\nThe generally weak new film scene led to strong holds for the usual suspects. Leading the way was “A Quiet Place” (down 30 percent, now at $160 million), “Black Panther” (down 34 percent, just under $700 million), and “Rampage” (off 35 percent, $84 million domestic, on track for over $400 million worldwide).\n\n$112,474,000 (-56%) in 4,474 theaters (no change); PTA (per theater average): $450,807,000\n\n8.

But he said these companies should follow official Chinese orders.\n\nAfter President Trump took office, he tried to foster a cordial relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and Mr. Trump says he and Mr. Xi are friends. But ties between China and the United States have become increasingly strained over Mr. Trump’s complaints that trade and investment flows and rules are significantly skewed in China’s favor.\n\nTalks on those complaints, which ended in Beijing on Friday, appeared to make little progress.\n\nThe flare-up over the airline websites showed that the Chinese government has its own acute sensitivities, especially over territorial issues — even in the obscure lists of countries and regions found on airline websites.\n\nTaiwan’s status has been in dispute since 1949, when Nationalist forces fleeing the Communists set up their government there. Tensions have risen in recent years because Beijing distrusts Taiwan’s current president, Tsai Ing-wen. She is skeptical of closer ties between authoritarian China and Taiwan, which has been a democracy since the 1990s.\n\nHong Kong has also become an increasingly sensitive issue for Beijing, which has tried to extend its influence over the former British colony, despite its distinct status as an administration region with its own laws. Chinese officials have been especially incensed by a small group of activists in Hong Kong who want it to seek independence.\n\nThe letter to the airlines appeared to add to growing Chinese efforts to influence how foreign companies refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong and other sensitive areas. In January, Delta Air Lines apologized for “an inadvertent error” after the Chinese authorities said it had listed Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website.\n\nIn January, Chinese officials temporarily suspended the Chinese website of Marriott International, accusing the hotel chain of listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries.\n\nMarriott promised that it would “absolutely not support any separatist organization that will undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”","author":"Chris Buckley","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T18:48:39.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/world/07China-orwell/07China-orwell-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"MuVNRlm63mA8AoFnxFtxSw==\n"}

Behind the scenes, however, one of the world's leading powers has quietly eyed the small state as a potential ground to project its power in the Middle East and into the Mediterranean. But it won't be easy.\n\nWith Syrian rebels and jihadis at bay, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government set to further extend its comeback, Russia has pursued a cautious overture across the border into Lebanon—a $1 billion dollar arms deal, including a 15-year repayment term at zero percent interest, as the Christian Science Monitor reported. Unlike Syria, Lebanon's precarious political makeup means there are no Kremlin-backed strongmen to turn to, but a rocky balance of power that has so far left the offer on the table.\n\n\"There is certainly an attempt to expand the soft Russian power in the region. This may translate into greater military cooperation and the signing (by the Lebanese) of a defense deal brokered last year,\" Maya Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told Newsweek. \"The parliamentary election results may have some impact to the extent of swaying the pendulum slightly towards a pro-Russia camp. However, given the delicate power/sectarian balance in the country, this may remain limited for now.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's quest to reinvigorate his country's military and political clout from its post-Soviet coma in the 1990s has put him on a collision course with the West, especially the U.S., which sees little more than its traditional Cold War rival once again gunning for superpowerdom. The U.S. and a number of its Western allies have accused Russia of election interference, cyber-attacks and even military provocations, especially along the tense borders between the U.S.-led NATO military alliance and Russia.\n\nIn the Middle East, this rivalry is playing out as well. Not only has Russia secured a near total victory for Assad in Syria, but it has shored up its long-term military presence in the Mediterranean by creating a permanent naval task force there and leasing two coastal installations—the Hmeymim air base and a naval facility in Tartus. While this concentration of Russian land, air and sea power makes it convenient to blast ISIS targets across the country, it also provides a powerful buffer overlooking NATO's southern flank in the Mediterranean.\n\nRelated: Iran Warns of New 'War' As It Boosts Ties With Syria, Iraq and Lebanon\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nArabic-language reports from pro-Russia Sputnik News and pro-Syria Al Mayadeen in February suggested that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had ordered the Russian military to look into establishing defense ties with Lebanon, specifically to open Lebanese ports to Russian warships, as The National Interest highlighted. The absence of this news in English-language or other mainstream media and the unknown fate of the $1 billion arms deal may signal that Russia's entrance into Lebanon did not go as smoothly as planned.\n\nLebanon, already beset by a war of influence between revolutionary Shiite Muslim Iran and ultraconservative Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia—and caught between restive Syria and proclaimed enemy Israel—may be Russia's biggest challenge yet. The country's government is largely divided by sect, with the president being Christian, the prime minister being Sunni Muslim and the speaker of the parliament being Shiite Muslim. The country has 128 parliamentary seats equally divided between Christian and Muslim sects, who themselves have a designated number of seats.\n\nDisruptions of Lebanon's balance of power often lead to violence, the worst being a civil war between 1975 and 1990 in which many of the country's current leading politicians and parties participated. Flare-ups have continued into the 21st century as the political landscape split into two main blocs: the March 8 alliance and the March 14 alliance. The former is closer to Iran, Russia's strategic partner in Syria. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether this relationship extends to Iran's allies in Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite Muslim Lebanese movement that dates back to the civil war and an overlapping struggle to oust an Israeli occupation, is often considered one of the world's most powerful paramilitary forces. It also retained significant control in Lebanon after the withdrawal of Syria in 2005, when the March 8 and March 14 blocs were established.\n\nConsidered a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel, Saudi Arabia and charged with playing a role in the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in 2005 by many of his majority-Sunni Muslim Future Movement supporters, Hezbollah is a leading force for the March 8 alliance, which gained major momentum after a 2006 memorandum of understanding was signed between Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and the Michel Aoun, who returned from exile in France.\n\nAoun, founder of the largely Maronite Christian Free Patriotic Movement and once fiercely anti-Syria, joined the March 8 Alliance and went on to become president in 2016, ending a 29-month deadlock. While the intricacies of Lebanon's confessional system often make uncomfortable alliances from former foes, the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia have expressed concern with the normalization of Hezbollah in Lebanese politics. Washington has preferred dialogue with the late Hariri's son, Saad al-Hariri, who leads the pro-West and Saudi-backed March 14 opposition as prime minister.\n\nUnlike the U.S., Russia has taken a multipolar approach to the Middle East. Rather than investing all of its resources in one camp, Moscow has maintained regular and cordial contacts with Egypt, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Qatar Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and other countries. Having showcased advanced weapons such as the S-400 air defense system to prospective regional buyers, Russia's $1 billion offer to supply the Lebanese Armed Forces appeared to be the natural extension of Putin's plan to boost his influence.\n\n\"Russia's recent offer to Lebanon comes as Moscow looks to continue to exploit its enhanced position in the region from its Syria intervention. Moscow has essentially stepped into almost every country in the region, especially those who currently have frayed relations with the U.S. (Egypt and Turkey in particular), to offer its top export: arms,\" Neil Hauer, a security analyst specializing in Russia and Syria, told Newsweek.\n\n\"In Lebanon, this also fills a gap left by Saudi Arabia's cancellation of a $3 billion military aid package in 2016, over concerns with the Lebanese government/army's unwillingness to crack down on Hezbollah,\" he added.\n\nAs Hauer points out, though, \"Russia does not have particularly close relations with Hezbollah, so this arms deal could be an attempt to bolster the army against the Iran-aligned Shia militia, much the same way the U.S. has tried to do in the past.\" He said he believed that \"that the primary goal of this deal, however, is to establish Russia as a significant player in Lebanon and one which the U.S. must now consider in its dealings with the country and its many political players.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't particularly think Russia will be successful, but I think that's their goal.\"\n\nSince 2006, the U.S. has already pledged up to $1.6 billion for the Lebanese Armed Forces. The non-sectarian army tries to keep its distance from Hezbollah, although the two local forces have worked in tandem as they tackled the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former Al-Qaeda affiliate, in the eastern barrens of Lebanon, near the Syrian border.\n\nThe relationship between Russia and Hezbollah is also ambiguous. The two work side-by-side with one another in support of Assad, but Moscow's ties to Israel and Saudi Arabia are not a fit for the self-proclaimed, anti-West \"Axis of Resistance\" that includes Hezbollah, Iran and Syria. Russia's role is getting especially uncomfortable as Israel intensifies its targeting of Iran and its allies in Syria.\n\nThese attacks, some claimed by Israel and others left unclaimed, have pushed both nations to the brink of war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also campaigning for President Donald Trump to cancel a historic 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, a move that threatened to erupt into conflict if Iran restarted its nuclear activities as it has threatened to do.\n\nIn the middle of this is tiny Lebanon. The country, still deeply scarred by its own civil war, has mostly disassociated from the conflict in Syria, but it has borne the brunt of a refugee crisis and its airspace has been repeatedly violated by combatants. Last month, Aoun condemned a suspected Israeli raid that used Lebanese airspace to fatally strike Iranian personnel in a Syrian airbase. Days later, the president again spoke out, this time against U.S. missiles flying over Lebanon to blast alleged chemical weapons facilities in Damascus and Homs. Iran and its allies have vowed to respond to both attacks. Russia, on the other hand, has called for calm.\n\nAs Russia asserts itself as the leading power broker in the region, it's set to inherit the daunting task of preventing a war between Iran and Israel. Yahya told Newsweek that, as the tensions mount, Lebanon may lean toward Russia in hopes that Moscow can break the dangerous cycle of violence and rhetoric that could plunge the country and region as a whole into a new war, one in which the U.S. has clearly chosen a side.\n\n\"At this point, many are looking to Russia to contain the evident escalation between Iran/Israel and prevent the outbreak of active conflict in Lebanon,\" Yahya said.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/ShaolinTomReporter","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T10:00:09.000Z"},"source":{"id":"newsweek","name":"Newsweek"},"urlToImage":"http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/02/gettyimages-930004078_0.jpg","digest":"biyVaE0O9198uhnq0yYLNA==\n"}

He has been taken in to custody.\n\nThe local deputy commissioner Ali Anan Qamar told AFP that the shooter said he carried out the attack over a small amendment to the oath that election candidates must swear which was hastily reversed last year after it was linked to blasphemy.\n\nThe controversy ignited a three-week sit-in last November by a previously little-known Islamist group which paralysed the capital and ended when the government capitulated to the protesters' demands -- including the ousting of the federal law minister -- in a deal brokered by the military.\n\nAt the time many Pakistanis and analysts warned that a dangerous precedent had been set in which fringe groups could bend the state to their will by citing blasphemy, a highly inflammatory charge in the conservative Muslim country.\n\nIqbal, known as a champion of Pakistan's much-persecuted religious minorities, was heavily involved in the negotiations at the time. He has previously condemned hate speech against groups such as the Ahmadis, an Islamic minority sect who were at the centre of last year's controversy.\n\nAfter the shooting he was rushed first to a local hospital and then airlifted to Lahore, where video footage released by his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) showed him being lowered from a helicopter on a stretcher, his eyes open as he responded to questions.\n\nDoctors later said he was in stable condition.\n\nThe attack was swiftly condemned by the international community, including the US ambassador and the French embassy, as Pakistanis voiced fears it represented an attempt to \"weaken democracy\" ahead of the federal elections, widely expected to be held late this summer.\n\nZiauddin Yousafzai, the father of Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, tweeted that he \"strongly condemned\" the attack, calling it \"(a) bad omen for upcoming general elections that is supposed to be free, fair and transparent.\"\n\nThe vote will only be Pakistan's second ever democratic transition, and with the PML-N in disarray since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was ousted by the Supreme Court over graft allegations last summer, there has been growing speculation it could be delayed.\n\nThe court banned Sharif from politics for life, while foreign minister Khawaja Asif was also ousted by the Islamabad High Court late last month for violating election laws.\n\nSharif and his supporters have repeatedly denied the allegations, suggesting they are victims of a conspiracy driven by Pakistan's powerful military to reduce the sway of their party.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the party has won a string of recent by-elections, proving it will likely remain a force in the vote.\n\nBlasphemy can be punishable by death under controversial Pakistani legislation, with even unproven allegations sparking mob lynchings and murders.\n\nHad the assassination attempt on Iqbal succeeded, it would not have been the first political killing linked to blasphemy: in 2011 then-Punjab governor Salman Taseer, a liberal who had called for reformation of the laws, was gunned down by his own bodyguard in broad daylight in Islamabad.\n\nIqbal, touted as a potential prime minister when Sharif was ousted last July, is a US-educated lawmaker from a political family long associated with the PML-N.\n\nConsidered the brains behind the party's development agenda, he previously headed up the planning ministry.\n\nPakistan's Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, 59, was shot in the right arm as he prepared to leave a public meeting in his constituency in Punjab province late Sunday\n\nPakistan interior minister Ahsan Iqbal was rushed first to a local hospital and then airlifted to Lahore, where video footage released by his ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) showed him being lowered from a helicopter on a stretcher","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T05:45:08.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Yahoo.com"},"urlToImage":"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UetuTUL9TbBVMPdZZJdTFw--~B/aD0zMzg7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_AU/Sports/Agence-FrancePresse/bf5003707fa4bc25069fa117b3faf2dc38591739.jpg","digest":"FjgYdklCKS2V90DQo06arQ==\n"}

The Kuwait crisis and the threat of Chinese missiles demand that we employ real foreign affairs experts who can craft and implement a foreign policy that is resolute but adaptable, strategic and pragmatic, amiable yet patriotic, especially in handling\n\n our territorial disputes.\n\n§ It is paramount that the administration upgrades our naval defenses with strategic naval vessels and equipment to better secure the country’s sovereignty and territories.\n\nHontiveros said the ‘’sheepish response’’ of the Duterte administration is “a grave insult to the bravery and sacrifices of Filipino soldiers who are guarding the country’s territories.”\n\nShe also said the administration is abdicating on its duty to protect the safety of Filipinos, particularly the fisherfolk.\n\n“Despite the lack of resources and infrastructure, our troops stationed and assigned in the West Philippine Sea have bravely maintained our presence in the region and ensured the integrity of our territory. It is thus a grave insult to our soldiers and a mockery of their sacrifices that the Duterte government has chosen to continue to be subservient to Chinese interests in the face of the country’s biggest security threat,” Hontiveros said.\n\n“Where is now the bravado of the so-called strongman? Binantaan at tinutukan na ng missiles ang ating mga sundalo sa West Philippine Sea, pro-China pa rin ang paninindigan ng kanilang Commander-in-Chief? Anong klaseng pamumuno yan? Isa itong malaking insulto sa katapangan at sakripisyo ng ating mga tropa na halos ibuwis ang lahat para lamang ipaglaban ang ating pambansang soberanya,” Hontiveros added.

This is an insult to our soldiers who are ready to sacrifice their lives in defense of Philippine sovereignty.)\n\nHontiveros also poked fun at the Duterte administration’s statement that the Chinese missiles are not directed at the Philippines.\n\nOn China’s ‘’fifth column,’’ Hontiveros said ‘’this is a statement that we expect from China’s fifth column not from the spokesperson of the country’s Commander-in-Chief.\n\n‘’Is it now the policy of this government to allow superpowers to install missiles in our backyard as long as they are not directed at us?” Hontiveros asked.\n\n“And how can they be sure? Were they informed by China about this? Did they have prior knowledge of the installation and existence of the missiles? Were they even there when they were installed? If not the Philippines, where are the missiles directed at? The government has a lot of explaining to do,” she stressed.","author":"Rizal Obanil","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T05:30:18.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Mb.com.ph"},"urlToImage":"https://news.mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/21762359_1628492757174999_3459586495022667070_o.jpg","digest":"Quni4asH9d2YMyfXy0dD4Q==\n"}

The villain made his goal quite clear in Avengers: Infinity War from the moment he showed up. The Mad Titan wanted to use the Infinity Gauntlet to bring about change, and change he does bring about before the movie ends. However, fans are starting to wonder if the change wrought will keep Thanos appeased or end up turning him into a hero by the time Avengers 4 comes around.\n\nWarning: major spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War beyond this point. If you want to remain unspoiled, you may want to stop reading now.\n\nTo make it clear, Thanos is no hero, and he has never been. The latest Avengers film sees him murder scores of people, and that is way before he has a completed Infinity Gauntlet in hand. He goes around the universe killing indiscriminately in the name of justice, and he weighs his own plans for so-called salvation above the lives of billions. Even when he isn’t slaughtering masses, Thanos took pride in torturing Nebula when she was a child, and Gamora was unwillingly turned into an assassin on his orders.\n\nSo, no — Thanos is not a hero, and he won’t become one anytime soon. That, however, doesn’t mean the Ma Titan will not align himself with the Avengers one day.\n\nIf you know a thing about the comics, then you already know Thanos does work with the Avengers during his Infinity Gauntlet shtick. In the comics, the Mad Titan does snap the universe in half, but he fails to keep the stones to himself. After fighting a horde a cosmic powers and all of Earth’s heroes, Thanos leave his body unattended by going on an astral walk, and it is then Nebula steals the Infinity Gauntlet away. He is nearly killed by the space pirate but is saved at the last moment by Adam Warlock and Doctor Strange.\n\nThe surprising encounter sees Warlock read Thanos’ soul, and the hero tells the Mad Titan they both know he always felt unworthy to wield the Infinity Gauntlet. Thanos admits that is the truth and chooses to help Warlock oppose Nebula with Doctor Strange and the Silver Surfer. And, once the Infinity Gauntlet is taken from Nebula, Thanos chooses to retire and tells Warlock he plans to seek penance for his megalomaniac past by living a peaceful life.\n\nOf course, the MCU will have trouble pulling out this turnaround the same way the comics did so. For one, a lot of important characters who were part of Thanos’ switch are not part of the MCU, but that doesn’t mean Avengers 4 cannot give the indisputable baddie a chance to right his massive wrongs. If the death of Gamora begins weighs to heavily on his mind or Thanos loses control of the gauntlet to someone who is even more corrupt, then he may be persuaded to team up with the Avengers — but that doesn’t make him a hero.\n\nNo, the egotist lost the right to consider himself a hero a long, long, long time ago.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is now playing in theaters. Other upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe movies include Ant-Man and the Wasp on July 6th, Captain Marvel opens on March 8, 2019, the fourth Avengers movie on May 3, 2019, the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming on July 5, 2019, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in 2020.\n\nDo you think Avengers 4 may force Thanos to work alongside the Avengers at some point?

Bush, a source close to McCain told NBC News.\n\nMcCain has been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer since being diagnosed with the disease in July. He is recovering at his Sedona, Arizona, home after undergoing surgery for an intestinal infection last month.\n\n“I don’t know how much longer I’ll be here,” McCain said in an excerpt released last week from his upcoming memoir, “The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and other Appreciations.”\n\n“Maybe I’ll be gone before you hear this,” he said in an audio recording of the excerpt. “My predicament is, well, rather unpredictable. But I’m prepared for either contingency, or at least I’m getting prepared.”\n\nHis son-in-law, Ben Domenech, reportedly said last week that McCain hugged him and asked him to “take care” of his daughter, Meghan. The couple married in November.\n\nGrant Woods, McCain’s friend and former chief of staff, told the Times that though McCain is receiving a lot of visitors, no one is actually saying goodbye, given that the senator doesn’t like “overt sentimentality,” he said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was among the recent visitors. The two men served together in the Senate, and McCain reportedly encouraged Biden to stay in politics. Biden, 75, has been rumored to be considering a run for the White House in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, Trump dismissed McCain’s heroism in the Vietnam War, saying he is “not a war hero” because he was “captured.” McCain, a Navy pilot, was repeatedly tortured during the more than five years he was held captive in North Vietnam. He said last fall that Trump never apologized for his insulting remark.\n\nMcCain also famously shot down his own party’s attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year. Trump, who had pushed hard for the repeal bill, called McCain’s move “totally unexpected” and “honestly terrible.”","author":"Nina Golgowski","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-06T14:47:58.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-huffington-post","name":"The Huffington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aef03421e000044008e49b6.jpeg?cache=0KEZurZh5U\u0026ops=1200_630","digest":"oxRIuxY15/Wx99eOjgXjKw==\n"}

In these times, I can think of no one better suited to serve as our president.”\n\nNorth will assume the presidency in the coming weeks and has retired from Fox News, where he was a commentator, effective immediately.\n\n“I appreciate the board initiating a process that affords me a few weeks to set my affairs in order, and I am eager to hit the ground running as the new NRA President,” North said in a statement.\n\nNorth, 74, worked on the staff of the National Security Council during in the Reagan White House when some within the administration sold U.S. arms to Iran in exchange for hostages and diverted part of the proceeds from those sales to help Nicaraguan contra forces. That type of aid was banned by Congress.\n\nNorth was convicted in 1989 of charges including obstructing Congress, unlawfully mutilating government documents and taking an illegal gratuity. He was fined $150,000, given a three-year suspended sentence and two years’ probation.\n\nA federal judge dropped the criminal charges against North in 1991.\n\nHe has long been active in the NRA, and is a member of its board.

This year's developer event delivers.","title":"Microsoft Build goes gaga for AI: Azure Machine Learning and beyond","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-microsoft-build-ai-azure-machine-learning-and-cosmos-db-go-big/","text":"For the first couple of years that Microsoft held its Build conference, the event was all about Windows. In the years since, the scope has widened and Build has become the company's broad annual developer confab. At this year's show, being held today through Wednesday in Seattle, there is no shortage of data- and AI-related announcements and demonstrations. If you needed proof that both are crucial to Microsoft's success, even eclipsing Windows in importance, this year's show is it.\n\nOn the AI side, there's so much to discuss, it's hard to know where to begin. Luckily, in a private briefing, Microsoft's Matt Winkler helped me understand the AI announcements at a depth that allows me to explain it better to you. Without that briefing, I'd just be regurgitating text from press releases. And that's no fun.\n\nI do so like AML and HAM\n\nI'll start with the part that is perhaps the most complicated to explain, but potentially the most interesting: the announced preview of Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models. (I am going to refer this service as AMLHAM - this is not Microsoft's acronym, mind you, and despite its sounding like a brand name for an unhealthy luncheon meat, it's still better than typing the full name out each time.)\n\nAMLHAM is the output of an internal project at Microsoft with the nerdy name of Project Brainwave, and it's all based on a hardware technology called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs. Let's take a look at these terms in one-at-a-time and see if we can't figure it all out.\n\nGimme an F, gimme a P\n\nAn FPGA is essentially a programmable chip - that is to say, a chip that allows the customer to specify how it should be wired. Since a chip is made up of a huge array of logic gates, and since the programming is done not at the factory, but by the customer (and, therefore, \"in the field\"), we end up with the name we have.\n\nBecause an FPGA is not hard-wired for its particular application at the factory, its manufacture is more generic than an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). But because the algorithm implemented in its custom programming is nonetheless hardware-based, the FPGA can significantly accelerate performance for that algorithm, compared to software-only implementations. And, as it turns out, machine learning algorithms are among those that FPGAs can turbo-charge. And that's how an FPGA-based architecture for deployed ML models leads to a service called Azure Machine Learning Hardware Accelerated Models.\n\nWhat's the code?\n\nBut how do we program the FPGAs in the first place? It turns out that isn't much easier than designing chips in the first place, even if it involves higher volume manufacturing of the hardware. But that's where Project Brainwave comes in: it can actually take a deep learning model and \"compile\" it into the instructions necessary to program the FPGA to implement the model.\n\nMicrosoft says that FPGA acceleration of models can actually be a good bit faster than GPU acceleration, so AMLHAM has the potential to create a super-fast AI infrastructure. And, even better than fast is cheap: Microsoft says that FPGA-accelerated models can deliver a 5x better price/performance ratio than would be possible without them.\n\nFirst things first\n\nAMLHAM won't initially deliver compilation of arbitrary deep learning models onto FPGAs. Instead, it will offer an FPGA-accelerated ResNet50 model, which can be used in a range of image processing applications. But that's just he beginning.\n\nBy the way, Google Cloud Platform's Cloud TPUs also enable hardware-accelerated models, but TPUs are specific to Google's TensorFlow deep learning framework and do not work generically across other algorithm libraries, according to Microsoft. AMLHAM, on the other hand, is framework-agnostic.\n\nYour packages have arrived\n\nIn addition to the AMLHAM-based ResNet50 model, Microsoft is also rolling out a preview of Azure Machine Learning \"packages\" for vision, text and forecasting. These packages are not full-blown models with simple APIs the way Azure Cognitive Services are, nor are they raw algorithms, such as those offered in CNTK or TensorFlow. Instead, they are models that can be customized for particular applications.\n\nAs an example, consider that a Cognitive Service for vision might operate at a scope where it recognizes people, animals and things, and therefore could scan your photo and tell you if there's a dog in it. But a vision package could be customized to the narrower use case of dogs only, and could then scan a photo and identify the breed of a dog in the photo. The packages are distributed as pip-installable extensions to Azure Machine Learning.\n\nAnd more\n\nBeyond the announced previews, the Day 1 Keynote is set to demonstrate a number of other AI breakthroughs:\n\nCosmic, continued...\n\nHad enough? We're not done yet, because Microsoft made a slew of announcements today around Azure Cosmos DB, the company's cloud-based globally distributed multi-model database.\n\nTo me, the two biggest of these announcements are previews of a \"Multi-Master\" capability, at global scale, and throughput provisioning for sets of containers.\n\nThe Multi-Master feature allows writes to be made, and synchronized across regions, with guaranteed consistency. In case you didn't know, that's hard to do. Once this feature reaches general availability, Microsoft will likely use it as part of a campaign to displace a lot of Amazon DynamoDB and Google Cloud Spanner business.\n\nThe provisioning feature allows throughput performance to be allocated for a database in aggregate instead of having to do so for each individual table. This will likely make Cosmos DB more affordable for smaller databases where the minimally required throughput per table, when multiplied by the number of tables in the database, made for a greater (and more expensive) aggregate provisioned throughput than was necessary. Being able to provision throughput for a set of containers addresses this issue, and it should help spur greater Cosmos DB adoption, since per-table throughput overhead will no longer make Cosmos DB cost-prohibitive for smaller projects.\n\nHey, hey, we need some GA\n\nIt's not all about previews, though. In addition, Microsoft announced general availability of three new Cosmos DB features:\n\nDuring Microsoft's Q3 earnings call a week ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Cosmos DB exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue, and did it in less than a year. He also stated he'd \"never seen a product that's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly\"\n\nThat's impressive, but there's still a long way to go. The announcements at Build today should help, quite a lot, as the new provisioning patterns will make the service more economically practical to more organizations and will encourage more tinkering by developers.\n\nAI, AI, go!\n\nAI has a long way to go, too, and the Azure Machine Learning platform is in many ways still immature and incomplete (which is not to say that competing offerings are much better). But today's announcements are rounding things out, and helping to achieve a unification of Azure's Cognitive Services, Machine Learning and analytics technologies. When that unification is complete, adoption rates will be in a position to snowball.\n\nThis year, the name \"Build\" is quite apropos.","author":"Andrew Brust","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T17:25:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Zdnet.com"},"urlToImage":"https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/e46731e3-1d18-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/7b7b4f5616f748bfe95dc172e674b73c/microsoft-build-2014.jpg","digest":"0nBEbVeO/TAJhcs8tHN9PQ==\n"}

(Reuters) - The first question Warren Buffett was asked at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual meeting on Saturday was whether he was “semi-retired,” having given four lieutenants oversight over the company’s operating businesses and some investments.\n\n“I’ve been semi-retired for decades,” the billionaire joked. Many in the audience of tens of thousands laughed.\n\n“Warren is very good at doing nothing,” Vice Chairman Charlie Munger later retorted. More laughter.\n\nHow long Buffett and Munger stay on is more serious.\n\nThey have built Berkshire into a $481 billion conglomerate whose dozens of businesses sweep across the American economy. Running it well, and doing a convincing job of it, would challenge many of even the best executives.\n\nBuffett is 87. Munger is 94. And that means change is likely soon, not just for Berkshire, but also for the weekend of events in Omaha, Nebraska, celebrating their accomplishments and values.\n\n“Warren and Charlie remain the principal show, but there is so much more to this culture,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor who has written books about Berkshire. “This is not a one-man show or a two-man show.”\n\nBuffett and Munger are still responsible for major Berkshire capital allocation and investment decisions.\n\nBut in January, Buffett tapped longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee Berkshire’s business units, making them front-runners to succeed him as chief executive.\n\nHe has also for several years given Todd Combs and Ted Weschler some Berkshire money to invest. They could become chief investment officer.\n\nBut none has Buffett’s and Munger’s public profile, magnetism, or history of investing success.\n\nBuffett and Munger took the rare step on Saturday to assure shareholders about Berkshire’s future under new leaders.\n\nMunger elaborated: “I think we’ve started something here that will work well enough that it will last. And one of the reasons it will last is, it’s not that damn easy to duplicate.”\n\nWhen they’re gone, shareholders expect Omaha’s largest annual event other than the College World Series of baseball to feel different, with fewer people coming for the meeting and the shopping discounts from Berkshire businesses.\n\n“Crowds will be smaller,” said Richard Callahan, a banker at Bank of the West in Omaha.\n\nLast Friday and Saturday at the downtown CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting is held, the line to buy underwear at the Fruit of the Loom booth sometimes stretched over 120 deep.\n\nPampered Chef cookware also drew long lines. See’s sold most of the 18,578 pounds of candies it brought. Dairy Queen offered 24,722 sweet treats and sold them all.\n\nAcross town, Borsheims Fine Jewelry, a Berkshire unit, hosted its Friday night cocktail reception. Ten thousand people were expected.\n\nKaren Goracke, Borsheims’ chief executive, said she wouldn’t expect Berkshire itself to run much differently under Abel or Jain, whom she has known for a decade.\n\n“People feel like they got to know Warren and Charlie personally,” Goracke said. “They feel very connected because they’ve had years to build that up. I expect there will be some transition. That’s just human nature.”\n\nDavid Brown, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, expressed optimism the weekend won’t lose its “Road to Mecca” feel.\n\n“We’ve all seen these iconic leaders in the past, and as soon as they left the companies weren’t what they purported to be,” he said. “We’re not going to see that with Berkshire.”\n\nMany shareholders believe they themselves can sustain the weekend.\n\n“The set of values Warren has built within us will carry on for much, much, much, much longer than any one individual,” said William Robertson, a firefighter and forester from Switzerland.\n\n“A lot of people here seem to be a familiar face,” said Peter Ringsmuth, who owns a publishing firm in Lincoln, Nebraska. “There’s some kind of bond.”\n\nThat’s reflected in the nocturnal fortitude of shareholders who line up for the meeting long before doors open at 7 a.m. Saturday.\n\nRobertson said he queued up at 11:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nJennifer Chu, a technology management consultant from Toronto, showed up at 4 a.m. Saturday, It was her first time seeing Buffett and Munger.\n\n“They’re both getting old, and this may be the last time to see them in person,” she said. “You never know.”","author":"Jonathan Stempel","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T17:12:57.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180507\u0026t=2\u0026i=1259445220\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE4618C","digest":"Fwx2Rm3gKbeMVWJWguyWtQ==\n"}

But the way the president's team is invoking gender is exactly why so many conservatives hate identity politics.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Haspel, the acting director of the CIA, sought to withdraw her nomination Friday after some White House officials feared the role she played in the interrogation of terrorism suspects could prevent her from being confirmed by the Senate. Here are details of her involvement, from The Post's report:\n\nIn late 2002, Haspel oversaw a secret CIA detention facility in Thailand, where one al-Qaeda suspect was waterboarded. Another detainee also was waterboarded before Haspel’s arrival.\n\nThree years later, Haspel was involved in the CIA’s destruction of nearly 100 videotapes that recorded the men’s interrogations, touching off an investigation by a special prosecutor who ultimately decided not to bring charges against those involved.\n\nAny advocate of women's empowerment who is so concerned about Haspel's past activity that they would vote against her becoming the first woman to head the CIA is a “hypocrite,” tweeted White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nTrump, who noted the most qualified person is “a woman,” claims criticism of Haspel is based on her being “too tough on terror.”\n\nThe White House might be sensitive about the lack of women in the Trump administration, given that 80 percent of nominations for top jobs in the Trump administration have gone to men, according to a Guardian report based on data from American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC that monitors Republican candidates.\n\nDespite Trump officials portraying the pushback to Haspel as partisan, the truth is concerns about Haspel's role in interrogation are coming from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe Post previously reported that when Haspel’s nomination was announced, Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said she would need “to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program.”\n\n“We now know that these techniques not only failed to deliver actionable intelligence, but actually produced false and misleading information,” McCain said in a statement in March. “Most importantly, the use of torture compromised our values, stained our national honor and threatened our historical reputation.”\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also said he was opposed shortly after Haspel's nomination was announced.\n\nOne of the most prominent lawmakers with questions for Haspel is Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the longest currently serving female U.S. senator and a strong advocate of getting more women in positions of leadership.\n\nFeinstein said on CBS's “Face the Nation” in April:\n\nI am of the opinion that putting somebody right now at the head of the CIA who played a role in, let's say, torture is not necessarily appropriate. I have met with Gina Haspel. I know her somewhat. I know that she is talented, but I also know that she was fully supportive of the program that many of us are very critical of. . . . She was supportive of the program while it was going on and actually supervised one of the sites where some of this 'interrogation' so-called went on. She's the number two position now. That's different from number one, the head of the CIA worldwide. There are countries that look very badly on what the United States did, particularly European countries. And we want whoever is head of the CIA to be able to be acceptable to our allies. So this is an open question in my mind. We need to resolve it.\n\nTrump, Sanders and those making similar points arguing criticism of Haspel is hypocritical either do not understand the argument those wanting more gender diversity in the Trump administration are making — or at worse, are appealing to tokenism.\n\nAs I previously wrote for the Fix, the expectation that liberals would celebrate Haspel's nomination simply because she is a woman displays a basic misunderstanding of the left's desire for more women in top positions of government. Liberals do not want to simply see more women in leadership. They want women with liberal values that critics of the Trump administration say Haspel lacks.\n\nHuman rights issues are not necessarily a gender issue or a partisan issue. If Haspel is the best person to lead the CIA despite criticism of her past involvement, she and the White House should be able to make that case before the Senate and the rest of America without accusing the lawmakers who are charged with confirming her of sexism.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202/","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T16:42:52.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LMh3B8M6cb7I03gg_7AfJoxyMPQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3FXNAPM6GI5TBM6DYX7OBRIX6M.jpg","digest":"zAUnw0RinyVttnc4pXB4xg==\n"}

All reckless endangerment counts and allegations that a member of now-shuttered Beta Theta Pi had erased basement security video to thwart investigators were thrown out.\n\nAll 11 face at least one count of hazing and at least one alcohol-related charge for the events that occurred the night in February 2017, when Tim Piazza suffered a series of falls and was badly injured inside the fraternity house. In all, 25 fraternity members are charged.\n\nPiazza, 19, of Lebanon, New Jersey, died of severe head and abdominal injuries after a night of drinking that followed a pledge bid acceptance ceremony. He fell down a set of basement steps, and the amount of alcohol in his system has been estimated at three or four times the state's legal limit for driving.\n\nAfter a separate preliminary hearing, another judge previously sent charges against 14 other members of the fraternity to county court for trial. In that case, the attorney general's office is seeing to reinstate dismissed charges of involuntary manslaughter against five defendants.\n\nLachman dismissed all three charges that Braxton Becker, 21, of Niskayuna, New York, had faced over the allegedly deleted security video — evidence tampering, obstruction and hindering apprehension or prosecution. A message left for his lawyer was not immediately returned.\n\nThe judge upheld a total of 35 counts of hazing and 37 alcohol-related offenses against the 11 defendants. In addition to Becker's charges, he also threw out five counts of reckless endangerment, 34 alcohol-related counts, two counts of hazing and one count of criminal conspiracy against various members of the group.\n\nAttorney Jeff Veitch's client, 20-year-old Joshua Kurczewski of Erie, remains charged with nine counts of hazing and eight alcohol-related counts, but the judge dismissed reckless endangerment, one count of hazing, conspiracy and nine alcohol-related charges.\n\n\"Obviously we're pleased to have 12 of the counts dismissed, particularly the most serious charges,\" Veitch said. \"I felt confident reckless endangerment and conspiracy surely would be dismissed.\"\n\nHe said the hazing counts could carry up to a year in jail, but with no criminal history it was unlikely Kurczewski would receive a term close to that long if he is convicted, Veitch said.\n\nA spokesman for the attorney general's office said he would soon issue a comment on the decision.\n\nProsecutors have said it is unclear whether the two sets of charges will be consolidated for trial.","author":"Mark Scolforo","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T16:24:07.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Chicagotribune.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-5af07d02/turbine/ct-penn-state-fraternity-death-20180507","digest":"zBYG+h4t0fbQghxCzzXe9g==\n"}

A victory by Mr. Blankenship would be highly embarrassing to Mr. Trump, coming on the heels of his inability to lift party nominees in Pennsylvania earlier this year and in Alabama last December when Democrats claimed a Senate victory in a reliably Republican state.\n\nWhite House aides and Senate Republicans have been discussing for the last week whether the president should comment on the primary and were in agreement that he should if it became clear Mr. Blankenship could win, three officials familiar with the deliberations said.\n\nBy Friday, when party officials received internal polling showing Mr. Blankenship was still in the hunt, they ratcheted up pressure on Mr. Trump to speak out against the coal executive, who was imprisoned until last year and remains on probation.\n\nYet the president has been so intensely focused on the special counsel’s investigation and the uneven defense offered by his new lawyer, the former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, that administration officials were not fully certain what Mr. Trump would do about the West Virginia race until the early morning tweet.\n\nMr. Trump did not need convincing, but some West Wing aides believe the fight is more about Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, than the president. And they grumbled in the hours after the tweet that some of the same lawmakers, namely Mr. McConnell, are inconsistent when it comes to what Mr. Trump’s policy should be on engaging in primaries.\n\nIn a statement responding to Mr. Trump, Mr. Blankenship said the president “is a very busy man and he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.” He added that the “establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the President’s agenda.”\n\nThe former chief executive of Massey Energy, Mr. Blankenship served a year in federal prison after being convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety rules following the Upper Big Branch mining disaster in 2010 that claimed 29 lives.\n\nHe has faced a series of attacks from establishment Republicans for his role in the tragedy. He has also been criticized for keeping his official residence in Las Vegas and refusing to fully disclose his extensive financial holdings.\n\nThe attacks sent Mr. Blankenship’s poll numbers tumbling, but with Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Morrisey dividing votes, he has remained in contention. Internal surveys taken by his rivals indicate that Mr. Blankenship is near the top of the field.\n\nThat is partly because he has framed his conviction as a persecution by former President Obama’s Justice Department, a strategy aimed at tapping into the deep animus toward a former president who many in the state believe waged a “war on coal.”\n\nAnd in recent weeks Mr. Blankenship dipped into his personal wealth to air a series of incendiary ads targeting the family of Mr. McConnell, the majority leader husband of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\n“Swamp Captain Mitch McConnell has given millions of jobs to China People,” Mr. Blankenship said in one commercial, alluding to the shipping business of Mr. McConnell’s father-in-law, an American citizen. In another spot, Mr. Blankenship dubbed Mr. McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” for far-fetched claims that a ship connected to Ms. Chao’s father once smuggled drugs.\n\nMr. McConnell, who is deeply unpopular among Republican primary voters, has largely sidestepped the attacks, but his allies have continued to assail Mr. Blankenship on the state’s airwaves. Mr. Trump, though, had been silent until Monday.\n\nThe president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., last week made a statement about the importance of stopping Mr. Blankenship. But until Monday, the closest the president had come to weighing in on the race was when he brought Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Morrisey to a tax-themed event he held in West Virginia and sat with them on either side. (He even polled the audience during the event to gauge who had more support in the room.)\n\nPart of the challenge for the establishment wing of the party has been that Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Morrisey have largely targeted one another, most recently during a bitter Fox News debate last week, and neither has been able to emerge as the clear front-runner. And Republican leaders did not have a strong preference between the two and so have not taken sides.\n\nMr. Jenkins is a former Democrat who represents the coal-producing part of the state, having upset a veteran incumbent in 2014, while Mr. Morrisey is a New Jersey transplant who made a name for himself suing the Obama administration.\n\nBoth candidates seized on Mr. Trump’s comments Monday morning, hoping to use them to persuade undecided voters less than 24 hours before polls open.\n\nIn a tweet of his own, Mr. Morrisey called Mr. Blankenship “a convicted criminal” who would be a “disaster” in the general election.\n\nMr. Jenkins wrote that he was “proud to have President Trump’s support,” even though the president had made no such endorsement.\n\nRepublican strategists believe that Mr. Manchin offers them one of their best opportunities to reclaim a Democratic seat, but that the conservative Democrat and former governor will easily win re-election if Mr. Blankenship is the nominee.\n\nAnd it is an all too familiar feeling for Senate G.O.P. officials: in December, the party handed over the Alabama seat once held by Jeff Sessions to Doug Jones, a Democrat, after nominating Roy S. Moore, a controversial former state judge who was accused by multiple women of making advances on them when they were teenagers, allegations that Mr. Moore denied.","author":"http://www.nytimes.com/by/jonathan-martin","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T16:07:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/us/08BLANKENSHIP-slide-BJ93/08BLANKENSHIP-slide-BJ93-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"eN+Rmm+SNSl+6tZqvoM4qw==\n"}

In particular, she called him “a creep” for standing close behind her during a town hall-style debate, a moment during the campaign she’s often brought up since the election.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nominee described her presidential election loss as a “perfect storm” involving former FBI Director James Comey, the media who covered her email scandal, Russian interference and division within the country.\n\n“The forces at work in the 2016 election in the United States are still with us and not only in my country but around the world,” Clinton said. “It was a perfect storm: deep currents of anger and resentment flowing through our culture. Our political press that told voters my emails were the most important story. The unprecedented intervention in our election by the FBI director. The information warfare waged from within the Kremlin.”\n\n“We're having a very important struggle in the United States right now,” she said, according to the Herald. “It's difficult to fully grasp because there are 20 stories and people are getting overwhelmed by the strange goings on we are living through.”\n\nShe told the audience she read mystery novels after she lost the election “because the bad guy usually gets it in the end.”\n\nTRUMP VS. CLINTON: THE FEUD CONTINUES EVEN AFTER THE ELECTION\n\n“You know, in the past, I felt like I had to be, kind of careful in public, sort of keep my guard up. Well those days are over, and I am so pleased that I can pull the curtain back in the book on the unprecedented election – the first reality TV election in American history,” Clinton said.\n\nHosted by The Growth Faculty, the former secretary of state discussed sexism, particularly in the U.S., and how she said it impacted her political aspirations. Tickets ranged from $195 to $595, according to the event page.\n\n“The more professionally successful we are, the less people like us,” Clinton said of women. She said she was “historically” liked whenever she served as the first lady or a member of former President Barack Obama’s Cabinet – but not when she decided to become a leader and run for president.\n\nShe praised New Zealand for recently electing its third female prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. She's the country's youngest prime minister since the 1850s.\n\nClinton said although she doesn’t plan to run against Trump in 2020, she believes he could be defeated since “we now know a lot more about the kind of campaign he runs and the kind of candidate he is.”\n\nShe said neither she nor the press “did the job they should have” when dealing with Trump.\n\n“Part of our problem was this unprecedented reality TV campaign, and he being the first reality TV candidate in our history,” Clinton told Stuff, New Zealand’s online publication. “The media didn’t know how to cover him. It was like they were watching a car wreck or a train wreck all the time.”\n\nHILLARY CLINTON SAYS BEING A CAPITALIST LIKELY HURT HER AMONG SOCIALIST DEMS\n\n“And his insults and his scapegoating and his horrible comments about people with disabilities and Latin Americans and immigrations and everybody – it was just so hard to understand,” she said. “So the press didn’t do the job it should have. I didn’t do the job I should have. I think people were almost mesmerized by this display.”\n\nClinton met with Ardern before her speech.\n\n“We had a good discussion, which included some domestic policy here in New Zealand that Mrs. Clinton had an interest in,” Ardern said after the meeting. She added that the pair talked about “being a mom” in the political world.\n\nClinton said they had a “broad-ranging substantive and personal conversation.” She told Stuff Ardern’s win was a “shot of optimism” for her after she lost the presidential election.\n\nThe two women also exchanged gifts. Clinton gave the mom-to-be a Buzzy Bee toy, and Ardern gave the former first lady children’s books for her grandchildren, the prime minister said. Clinton said she also gave Ardern a personalized copy of her book, “What Happened.”\n\nClinton is traveling to Australia next.","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T15:42:16.000Z"},"source":{"id":"fox-news","name":"Fox News"},"urlToImage":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/politics/2018/05/07/hillary-clinton-goes-after-reality-tv-trump-in-new-zealand-speech/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1525703556572.jpg?ve=1","digest":"pMWrhHtxq3h05R08ynB1lg==\n"}

It was their second time in Israel, and the visiting couple were served a top-notch meal by celebrity Israeli chef Segev Moshe.\n\nIsrael’s popular daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot wrote Monday that “Japanese diplomats, Israeli Foreign Ministry officials and high-ranking Israeli diplomats who previously served in Japan were shocked by the idea.”\n\n“This was an insensitive decision,” the article quoted one unidentified senior Israeli official as saying. “There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won’t find shoes in their offices. This is disrespect of the first order.”\n\nA Japanese diplomat, also not named by the paper, said: “There’s no culture in the world in which you put shoes on the table. What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humor, we don’t think it is funny; we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.”\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said it was not involved in approving the dishes for the meal.\n\n“We respect and appreciate the chef. He is very creative,” the ministry said in an initial statement. After this report was published, the ministry amended its statement to add: “We have the utmost respect for the Japanese prime minister.”\n\nSegev's creative side was displayed last May when President Trump visited Israel. Then, the celebrity chef served up a dessert in the shape of a double-headed Trump and Netanyahu.\n\nOn Sunday, Segev proudly posted a close-up photo of the offending shoe-filled dessert on his Instagram account, writing: “Chocolate selection from the world by #SegevArt ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / A metal shoe by @tomdixonstudio”\n\n“The dessert was served inside a sculpture by international artist Tom Dixon, whose works are displayed in major museums around the world and for the first time was displayed in Israel at a meal. This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe; it is not a real shoe,” Segev's publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.\n\nOn Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:\n\n“When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is inquire about the guest. In Japan, shoes are considered contemptible, they always take off their shoes at the entrance to every home, both for themselves and for others,” wrote one person.\n\nAnother person wrote: “you don’t need to know any culture to know that serving shoes at a dinner is WRONG!”\n\nServing dessert in a shoe was not the only controversy caused by the visit. On Friday, Netanyahu uploaded a short video clip to his Facebook account complaining about a lack of media coverage of the visit.\n\n“I want to tell you something, Japan’s prime minister visited here. He leads the world’s third-largest economy. He brought with him an enormous delegation of businessmen, the heads of the largest corporations. You know the names: Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and many others. Did you hear anything about this in the media? Nothing! So open my Facebook and learn about this,” said Netanyahu in Hebrew.\n\nIsraeli journalists responded by pointing out that the Hebrew media ran more than 50 items about various aspects of the trip, the Times of Israel news website reported. They also highlighted that the two leaders did not hold a news conference.\n\n“Prime minister perhaps it’s time to stop with the fake news!!! Not only did you not allow the journalists into your meetings with the Japanese prime minister, except for pool photographers, the media did actually report on this visit. So maybe you should delete this embarrassing post?” wrote Itamar Eichner, Yediot Aharonot's longtime diplomatic correspondent.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/reglash","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T15:08:37.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DzroMEunqC28Mi_lCMGbZQIE0Vw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7NQGZHLYVE3XJGSDMSTIRAGIJY.jpg","digest":"vJJ9mrPd86aQh3qIywrKUw==\n"}

Trump and his allies complain that the past political support of Democrats by people inside the special counsel's office means they cannot investigate honestly.\n\nThe House intelligence committee's majority Republicans said they found no conspiracy between Trump campaign aides and the Russian attack on the 2016 election and that the contacts between campaign aides and Russians were simply \"ill-advised.\"\n\nThe panel's minority Democrats argued that Republicans did not conduct a serious and complete investigation.\n\nTrump argues that the majority report should have ended the matter, but the Justice Department and Senate intelligence committee Russia investigations remain open — which irks the president.\n\n\"Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended?\" Trump wrote later on Monday. \"Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\"\n\nTrump probably has little to fear from his own Republicans. House Judiciary and intelligence committee members have been complaining for months about what they call the \"bias\" in the FBI and Justice Department and the abuses of power they say have been uncovered.\n\nThey also have been targeting Mueller specifically since last year — Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, for example, said in November that Mueller's office amounts to an insurgency within the federal government.\n\n\"We are at risk of a coup d'état in this country if we allow an unaccountable person with no oversight to undermine the duly elected president of the United States — and I would offer that is precisely what is happening right now,\" he said.\n\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., followed up with his declassified memo and then the final report that Trump has embraced. And although Trump's lawyers spent much of the intervening time careful to say they were cooperating with Mueller if not praising him outright, that line has changed.\n\n\"There's no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,\" attorney Rudy Giuliani told ABC's This Week on Sunday. \"I happen to believe it's greater than anybody realizes. Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.\"\n\nGiuliani was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before he was elected to mayor of New York City and, more recently, added to the Trump team. He said on Sunday that given the way that Mueller's office has \"undermined\" itself, he had to hold open the option for Trump not to cooperate.\n\nGiuliani cited the remarks of federal Judge T.S. Ellis III on Friday, who asked why the special counsel's office is prosecuting former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on bank fraud and money laundering charges apparently unconnected to Russia's active measures.\n\n\"We have situations like Judge Ellis saying that they're out of control and they're not authorized, and they refuse to give the judge their authorization — what's going on with that, George?\" Giuliani asked. \"God almighty.\"\n\nEllis asked prosecutors to give him a confidential copy of the full order from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that appointed Mueller and set out the scope of his investigation. The copy that has been made public is heavily redacted since it includes secret foreign intelligence information.\n\nNunes and House Republicans want that document, too, as part of their campaign to prove that Mueller's office has overstepped its authority. The Justice Department has resisted, as it also is resisting giving Nunes other materials in the Russia case, including documents related to its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nNunes says if he doesn't get what he wants, he'll push for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be held in contempt of Congress.\n\nThere are legal reasons as well as political reasons for Trump not to give an interview to Mueller, outside attorneys say.\n\nThe special counsel's office already has concluded guilty pleas with people who've admitted lying to investigators, and the same risk could apply in an extreme situation if Mueller got a subpoena to try to compel Trump to appear before a grand jury.\n\n\"It would be very risky, I think, for the president to go in,\" former Associate Deputy Attorney General Matt Olsen told NPR on Monday, \"certainly if he thinks that he can go before the grand jury and try to deceive the grand jury — because there's so much ... that the special counsel knows already.\"\n\nWhat it all boils down to is an environment in which Trump may benefit legally from not cooperating and pay no political price with allies in Congress and his most loyal supporters.\n\nEven so, Trump or his legal advisers may not simply be able to issue a blanket declaration that the president won't talk. Olsen suggested they may have to respond to individual questions, or individual topic areas like those that have appeared in the press.\n\n\"You really have two choices: You tell the truth or you take the Fifth Amendment,\" Olsen said. \"The president, like any witness, has the right to plead the Fifth ... [but] an important point here is that you cannot just assert a blanket Fifth Amendment 'I'm not going to testify.' That has to be asserted on a question by question basis.\"","author":"Philip Ewing","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T15:00:03.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Npr.org"},"urlToImage":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/07/gettyimages-622462016_wide-b6dc1ffa63505a3ab1975da0229cd89850d8b9a8.jpg?s=1400","digest":"henJ5T+AzFi+yMcWEHOAxQ==\n"}

Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!”\n\nBlankenship has taken aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with racially charged accusations of corruption. He responded that Trump doesn’t know him and “the establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the US Senate and promote the president’s agenda.”\n\nHe added: “As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on Monday on Fox and Friends said the president’s tweet against Blankenship are meant to avoid internal battles among Republicans and “find the very best person” in West Virginia to challenge incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat.\n\nTrump is citing Alabama Republican Roy Moore, who lost a special Senate election after allegations of past sexual misconduct. Trump endorsed Moore in that race.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday defended Gina Haspel, his nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency, dismissing debate over her involvement in a harsh interrogation program and arguing Democrats want her out because she “is too tough on terror.”\n\nTrump said on Twitter that Haspel has “come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists.” He added that “in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!”\n\nHaspel offered to withdraw her nomination, two senior administration officials said Sunday, amid concerns that a debate over a harsh interrogation program would tarnish her reputation and that of the CIA.\n\nWhite House aides on Friday sought out additional details about Haspel’s involvement in the CIA’s now-defunct program of detaining and brutally interrogating terror suspects after 9/11 as they prepared her for Wednesday’s confirmation hearing. This is when she offered to withdraw, the officials said.\n\nThey said Haspel, who is the acting director of the CIA, was reassured that her nomination was still on track and will not withdraw. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The news was first reported Sunday by The Washington Post.\n\nHaspel, who would be the first woman to lead the CIA, is the first career operations officer to be nominated to lead the agency in decades. She served almost entirely undercover and much of her record is classified. Democrats say she should be disqualified because she was the chief of base at a covert detention site in Thailand where two terrorism suspects were subjected to waterboarding, a technique that simulates drowning.\n\nShe has told lawmakers in recent weeks that she would stand firm against any effort to restart the brutal detention and interrogation program, administration officials told The Associated Press on Friday. She is expected to reiterate that publicly this week.\n\nHaspel, one official said, was wary of suffering the same fate as failed veterans affairs nominee Ronny Jackson and of dredging up the CIA’s troubled past. She took over last month as the acting CIA director after the previous director, Mike Pompeo, was sworn in as secretary of state.\n\nAfter Haspel’s offer to withdraw, White House aides worked to reassure her that she had the president’s support.\n\nAs with other nominations, this one hit a roadblock but is back on track, said a third administration official familiar with the effort to get her confirmed.\n\nHaspel’s conversations with senators continue ahead of Wednesday’s confirmation hearing at the Senate Intelligence Committee and a later full vote in the Senate.\n\nIn addition, the CIA has sent materials to the Senate, some classified, that the lawmakers can read to better understand not only her work in the Counterterrorism Center, which oversaw the harsh interrogation program, but also other aspects of her 33-year career, including more than 30 years undercover.\n\nShe has received robust backing from former intelligence, diplomatic, military and national security officials, who praise her extensive intelligence career.\n\nOn the opposing side are groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which says she should have stood up against the interrogation practices then.\n\nRaj Shah, a White House spokesman, on Sunday called Haspel a highly qualified nominee. “Her nomination will not be derailed by partisan critics who side with the ACLU over the CIA on how to keep the American people safe,” he said.\n\nCopyright 2018 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit.

He said Russia needs to expand freedoms for entrepreneurs and scientists, to invest in regional development and to raise the quality of education and health care. A particular focus on “traditional family values,” he said, would ensure as many births as possible.\n\n“Russia is a strong, active and influential participant in international life,” Putin said. “But now we must use all the means we have at our disposal to, first, resolve domestic, most vital challenges of development.”\n\nAs are many of Putin’s events, Monday’s inauguration was meticulously choreographed for a television audience.\n\nBefore his speech, the 65-year-old leader arose from his office desk, donned a suit jacket and walked, for considerable time and with signature swagger, down the red-lined Kremlin halls to a Russian-made limousine, state television showed. Putin then took the oath of office in the resplendent pink marble Andreyevsky Hall, the throne room of Russia’s czars in the Grand Kremlin Palace. The lavish ceremony was full of pomp and splendor, featuring cavalry in brocaded livery and simultaneous cannon fire.\n\nIn an apparent bid to show the breadth of Putin’s popularity, activists and volunteers from his reelection campaign joined official dignitaries among the 6,000 guests. Also attending was American action star Steven Seagal, whom Putin presented with a Russian passport in 2016, and the leather-clad leader of a pro-Kremlin motorcycle club who is known as “The Surgeon.”\n\nFormer German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also came, prominently standing on the front row besides Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Dmitry Medvedev, who served as prime minister in Putin’s last term and has been nominated for a new term.\n\n“The purpose of my life will be, as before, service to the people, to our fatherland,” Putin said after he swore on Russia’s constitution.\n\nUnder the constitution, this six-year term is supposed to be Putin’s last, but speculation has mounted in Moscow that he will seek to hold on to power in some way after 2024, perhaps by taking on a new, leader-of-the-nation role.\n\nFor now, Putin’s dominance of the nation’s political system seems ironclad. His popularity surged after he annexed the territory of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and many Russians have accepted his call to unite around the Kremlin amid the confrontation with the West. To his supporters, Western sanctions and accusations of Putin’s complicity in U.S. election interference or Olympic doping are simply means of keeping their country down.\n\nIn his patriotic inauguration speech, Putin focused entirely on Russia, but he hinted at the standoff with the West when he said: “The country’s security and defense capabilities are reliably ensured. We will continue giving these issues the constant attention they need.”\n\nAnd while Putin’s foreign-policy legacy after nearly two decades in power reflects a rise in Russia’s geopolitical ambitions that many Russians support, his accomplishments at home are less clear-cut. Putin benefited from rising oil prices early in his tenure, but since 2008, Russia’s stagnant economy has grown at an average of just over 1 percent a year.\n\nShowcasing Russia’s manufacturing potential, Putin swapped his armored Mercedes-Benz for the domestically made Cortege on Monday. Officials and analysts took to Russian state television to praise the car, hailing the automobile’s entrance on the market as an achievement for the Russian people.\n\nIn his state-of-the-nation address in March, Putin promised to halve the poverty rate over the next six years and to double government spending on roads, health care and regional development.\n\nWhether he intends significant economic reform could become clearer as he forms his government in the coming weeks. The relatively liberal former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, could rejoin the government, analysts say, but hard-liners within the Kremlin who are prepared to keep up the confrontation with the West are unlikely to lose their influence.\n\nUntil now, Putin’s promises to improve Russians’ lives at home have been overshadowed by conflict with the West — notably including nuclear saber rattling and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England, for which Britain blames the Kremlin.\n\nThere are some signs that Russians are growing impatient with slow economic growth and public corruption. Protests in the aftermath of a Siberian mall fire that killed 60 led to the resignation of a regional governor in April. Anti-Putin rallies organized by opposition leader Alexei Navalny across the vast country on Saturday brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets, and more than 1,600 of them were arrested.\n\nAs the guests filed out of the Kremlin after Monday’s ceremony, there was little talk of rapprochement with the West. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Western countries should “normalize their attitude toward Russia.” The biker-group leader known as “The Surgeon,” Alexander Zaldostanov, said he expected the pressure on Russia to increase, prompting Russians to respond by uniting even more around their leader.\n\n“Our president will collect everyone in his fist,” Zaldostanov said in an interview, after noting that the Kremlin celebration marked the first time he had worn a white shirt. “I’m ready not to eat enough, not to sleep enough — but you can’t put me down.”\n\nSanctions, Syria hit home in Russia, but people aren’t turning against Putin\n\nPutin wants a shining legacy. He has to solve 3 problems first\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T14:27:24.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MOjNtSeJwWt7jPawgR-MNr18PvM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OBQXQHCR7YI6RHERPWVVS3UCKI.jpg","digest":"ypNJGXbyG3O+xdepJHqO8g==\n"}

However, they do admit that ComicBook.com's guess of \"Avengers: Forever\" is the closest anyone has come to get the title right. Joe Russo then went on to joke about just how close this title guess actually was: \"The actual title is The Avengers: Almost Forever.\"\n\nWith the title of \"Infinity Gauntlet\" having been officially ruled out, the directors admit they are merely adapting a version of the Marvel Comics source material rather than directly following it in a predictable manner.\n\n\"I don't think there are any comics that correlate to it,\" Joe Russo said. \"I think we're in pretty fresh territory with Avengers 4. If anything, I think it's interesting after to go back and look at some of the Marvel films and view them through a different lens. But I can't think of any comics in particular that would have value.\"\n\nSuch an approach is how the Russo Brothers plan to dodge any stories involving Adam Warlock, who will not be appearing in their upcoming ensemble film.\n\n\"Our job as we said a million times is to tell the story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not to do direct adaptations of the comics because we're comic book fans,\" Joe Russo said. \"I have no interest as a director in telling a story that's already been told or in seeing one that's already been told.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5af0ce535a90676be2aa3750"},"description":"There’s a lot going on here.","title":"What It Means When Childish Gambino Says 'This Is America'","url":"http://www.vulture.com/2018/05/what-it-means-when-childish-gambino-says-this-is-america.html","text":"Until last Saturday night, the last we had heard out of Childish Gambino was another man’s funk. For all its considerable energy and for all of the critical acclaim it received, the artist’s previous release, “Awaken, My Love! was a throwback album content to bask in the auras of George Clinton’s Parliament Funkadelic instead of blazing an aesthetic trail of its own. The album’s performance reinforced the existing view of Donald Glover as a talent whose prodigious nature precluded any kind of fixed commitment. When you can do anything well, why do anything for long?\n\nThe charm of such an approach — an endless series of apprenticeships, no mastery in sight — was evident. Following Glover’s career, you were always on your toes: anything could come next. This sense of anticipation would only grow once Glover began his work on Atlanta. As a showrunner, writer, and actor, he promoted a worldview where unpredictability took precedence over perfection. Atlanta is odd, encrypted; its flashes of genius gain in frequency but never gather themselves into a pattern. It was a huge and ongoing leap forward for Glover’s art, and as the new video for Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” shows, its shock of its impact has jarred his music out of competent, complacent imitation. As its title suggests, “This Is America” inhabits the present. The spirit of placid revival had vanished along with Obama’s departure from office.\n\nThere had been, to be sure, an alternative vision embodied in the word “America,” one that placed an emphasis on ideals like universal liberty and equality of justice under the law, but this lofty mirage had never managed to elude the matter of its implication in the violence of American racism. Created by guns, overflowing with guns, America had always been a sort of rhetorical weapon, its greatness a cudgel applied to recalcitrant people of color at home or abroad. What the Trump campaign and election signaled was an abolition of all alternative Americas, the permanent reduction of the nation to a weapon directed at people whose skin is not pale.\n\nIt’s tempting to read the “This Is America” video, directed by a Japanese-American director (Hiro Murai, who also directs Atlanta) and pouring over with black people and black voices, simply as an attempt to restate an alternative, but such a reading would make light of the dilemmas Murai and Glover have carefully inscribed into their vision. Jubilant black culture abounds not only in resistance to the lethal violence directed at its makers, but also in complicity with it: when Glover stages the murder of a black guitarist and a black church choir, it’s not a white policeman pulling the trigger, but Glover himself, and after each killing he resumes his dancing with the same livewire energy and his rapping with the same assured flow, as if nothing had happened. If black culture affirms itself, accurately, as a testament to its makers’ capacity for grace, invention, and vigor in the face of an inhuman social reality, Glover’s own affirmation contains a shadowy admission that such makers cultivate their own agony in the act of representation.\n\nMuch as Atlanta exists in the lacuna between Atlanta and Atlanta, “This Is America” draws life from the unsolvable tension within a society whose bloody business is transmuted into cultural potency at relentless speed. The similarity is no accident, either: just as its abrupt shifts in tempo and Murai’s direction cements the video’s link with Glover’s show, the influence of Atlanta, and the Southern rap of which it serves as capital, pervade “This Is America” like a fine mist. Ad-libs are chipped in by the likes of Young Thug, Slim Jxmmi, Blocboy JB, 21 Savage, and Quavo; Thug performs an outro; Blocboy’s dance is replicated in the video.\n\nBut it’s the prosody and content of Glover’s lyrics that display the influence most deeply: with its cash-grabbing, fashion-mongering, gun-waving, drug-slinging rhetoric delivered in a clipped triplet flow, the song is a trap number in all but name. The incongruousness of Glover, raised middle-class and a NYU graduate, bragging about his Mexican drug supplier and threatening to have you gunned down, is intentional: it’s a tribute to the cultural dominance of trap music and a reflection on the ludicrous social logic that made the environment from which trap emerges, the logic where money makes the man, and every black man is a criminal. Donald Glover doesn’t trap, but he’s trapped; he runs his own television show, and is always on the run. Only one country could be this bizarre, and no matter what he does, he can only point in its direction.","author":"Frank Guan","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T21:21:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Vulture.com"},"urlToImage":"https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/07/07-childish-gambino-2.w1200.h630.jpg","digest":"WQRaNM/9p9YEN6qpKWynnw==\n"}

But Monday she outlined her initiative focused on children — at a moment when her husband is under intense scrutiny.","title":"In Traditional First-Lady Style, Melania Trump Unveils 'Be Best' Initiative","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/07/608517444/in-traditional-first-lady-style-melania-trump-unveils-her-policy-goals","text":"In Traditional First-Lady Style, Melania Trump Unveils 'Be Best' Initiative\n\nMelania Trump often seems like a reluctant first lady. But she stepped into the spotlight this week to take on a very traditional part of the role.\n\nMrs. Trump unveiled a new initiative Monday, called \"Be Best,\" which she said aims to educate children \"about the many issues they are facing today.\" As President Trump looked on in the Rose Garden, Mrs. Trump outlined the initiative's three pillars: well-being, social media use and opioid abuse. \"Children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence,\" the first lady said.\n\nThe White House says \"Be Best\" will promote \"values such as healthy living, encouragement, kindness and respect.\" It will also highlight the importance of using social media and the Internet \"in positive ways.\" And it will support families and children affected by the opioid crisis.\n\nFollowing her remarks, the president signed a proclamation and said the nation is \"truly blessed to have a first lady so devoted to our country and to our children.\"\n\nMonday's announcement comes at a moment when the president is under intense scrutiny.\n\nMelania Trump rarely campaigned with her husband and waited months after his inauguration before moving to the White House. But she has made occasional appearances that offer clues about her priorities.\n\nHer spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tells NPR there are \"many issues\" facing children today, and that the first lady's initiatives will try to help them to handle those challenges. Grisham says the first lady will continue to focus on many of the subjects she has addressed in the past.\n\nEven before she became first lady, Melania Trump waded into what might seem like surprising territory for the wife of Donald Trump.\n\n\"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\" she said in a campaign speech in Pennsylvania just days before the 2016 election. There she talked about the downsides of the Internet, especially for kids who are bullied and mocked online.\n\nThe irony was hard to miss, as she acknowledged at a White House forum in March.\n\n\"I'm well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic, but it will not stop me from doing what I know is right,\" Trump said.\n\nSocial media and its effect on children will be one part of Melania Trump's agenda, Grisham said before Monday's event. Children and opioid addiction will also be a priority.\n\nIn a speech to the United Nations in September 2017, Trump talked about several issues affecting children, including bullying, poverty and addiction. In October, she traveled to West Virginia, where she visited a treatment center for infants exposed to opioids.\n\nShe returned to that subject at a White House event on opioids later that month, where she said, \"addiction affects children in many different ways, and I have recently taken a larger interest in what I can do to help fight this epidemic.\"\n\nNo playbook for first ladies\n\nPresidents' wives have often found both themselves and their platforms under intense scrutiny.\n\nSpeaking in 2013, then-first lady Michelle Obama acknowledged the unwanted attention on her appearance — from her shoes to her bangs. But she said despite that, being first lady gave her a big opportunity.\n\n\"We take our bangs, and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see,\" Obama said.\n\nAmerican first ladies have traditionally chosen a range of issues of public concern, often causes related to public health. Abigail Adams advocated for women's rights; Lucy Hayes, the wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes, was involved in the anti-alcohol temperance movement.\n\nMore recently, Nancy Reagan was known for her involvement in the \"Just Say No\" anti-drug campaign. Obama tackled childhood obesity with her \"Let's Move\" campaign, which drew the ire of some of her conservative critics.\n\nPeter Slevin, who teaches journalism at Northwestern University and wrote a biography of Michelle Obama, says there's \"no playbook\" for how a first lady should operate. He says each presidential spouse must develop her own set of priorities and plan for executing them.\n\nSlevin says that may be especially challenging for Melania Trump.\n\n\"She's dealing with a White House that is not exactly good at delivering a consistent message,\" he says. \"And in her own case, she comes with no experience at all in politics; even as her husband was running for office, she was in the background.\"\n\nThese days, much of the attention on the White House has focused on legal questions surrounding President Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. He has denied those allegations.\n\nEven so, Melania Trump is pressing forward with her plans almost as if nothing has happened.\n\nMyra Gutin, a historian of American first ladies at Rider University, says some president's wives would have been put off by the controversies swirling around the White House — but not Trump.\n\n\"She seems to sort of roll with whatever occurs, and the fact that she's going to get this initiative rolled out and finally moving seems to say to me that she's going to be focused on the good that she can accomplish while she's in the White House,\" she says.\n\nGutin said the decision to focus on children is a good one, and in line with what past first ladies have done.\n\n\"She seems to be at her best when she's with young children, visiting them in the hospital, reading to them,\" Gutin says. \"It just brings out a naturalness in her that I haven't seen in other situations.\"\n\nGutin said first ladies tend to be more popular than their spouses — which could give Melania Trump a chance make progress on her goals, regardless of what her husband is doing.","author":"","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T20:32:20.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Npr.org"},"urlToImage":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/07/ap_18127724519296melania_wide-c8a9ef7f38eb72e2ecf7f80e98141373c43d403b.jpg?s=1400","digest":"0sXOmRGnJipGDjhmhvbg8A==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5af0ce635a90676be2aa375c"},"description":"Cloud giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are looking forward to a world where the “cloud” spreads to the “edge.” So, what does that mean?","title":"What is edge computing?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/7/17327584/edge-computing-cloud-google-microsoft-apple-amazon","text":"Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have proven to us that we can trust them with our personal data. Now it’s time to reward that trust by giving them complete control over our computers, toasters, and cars.\n\nAllow me to introduce you to “edge” computing.\n\nEdge is a buzzword. Like “IoT” and “cloud” before it, edge means everything and nothing. But I’ve been watching some industry experts on YouTube, listening to some podcasts, and even, on occasion, reading articles on the topic. And I think I’ve come up with a useful definition and some possible applications for this buzzword technology.\n\nIn the beginning, there was One Big Computer. Then, in the Unix era, we learned how to connect to that computer using dumb (not a pejorative) terminals. Next we had personal computers, which was the first time regular people really owned the hardware that did the work.\n\nRight now, in 2018, we’re firmly in the cloud computing era. Many of us still own personal computers, but we mostly use them to access centralized services like Dropbox, Gmail, Office 365, and Slack. Additionally, devices like Amazon Echo, Google Chromecast, and the Apple TV are powered by content and intelligence that’s in the cloud — as opposed to the DVD box set of Little House on the Prairie or CD-ROM copy of Encarta you might’ve enjoyed in the personal computing era.\n\nMost of the new opportunities for the “cloud” lie at the “edge”\n\nAs centralized as this all sounds, the truly amazing thing about cloud computing is that a seriously large percentage of all companies in the world now rely on the infrastructure, hosting, machine learning, and compute power of a very select few cloud providers: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM.\n\nAmazon, the largest by far of these “public cloud” providers (as opposed to the “private clouds” that companies like Apple, Facebook, and Dropbox host themselves) had 47 percent of the market in 2017.\n\nThe advent of edge computing as a buzzword you should perhaps pay attention to is the realization by these companies that there isn’t much growth left in the cloud space. Almost everything that can be centralized has been centralized. Most of the new opportunities for the “cloud” lie at the “edge.”\n\nSo, what is edge?\n\nThe word edge in this context means literal geographic distribution. Edge computing is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data, instead of relying on the cloud at one of a dozen data centers to do all the work. It doesn’t mean the cloud will disappear. It means the cloud is coming to you.\n\nThat said, let’s get out of the word definition game and try to examine what people mean practically when they extoll edge computing.\n\nOne great driver for edge computing is the speed of light. If a Computer A needs to ask Computer B, half a globe away, before it can do anything, the user of Computer A perceives this delay as latency. The brief moments after you click a link before your web browser starts to actually show anything is in large part due to the speed of light. Multiplayer video games implement numerous elaborate techniques to mitigate true and perceived delay between you shooting at someone and you knowing, for certain, that you missed.\n\nEdge computing has privacy benefits, but they aren’t guaranteed\n\nVoice assistants typically need to resolve your requests in the cloud, and the roundtrip time can be very noticeable. Your Echo has to process your speech, send a compressed representation of it to the cloud, the cloud has to uncompress that representation and process it — which might involve pinging another API somewhere, maybe to figure out the weather, and adding more speed of light-bound delay — and then the cloud sends your Echo the answer, and finally you can learn that today you should expect a high of 85 and a low of 42, so definitely give up on dressing appropriately for the weather.\n\nSo, a recent rumor that Amazon is working on its own AI chips for Alexa should come as no surprise. The more processing Amazon can do on your local Echo device, the less your Echo has to rely on the cloud. It means you get quicker replies, Amazon’s server costs are less expensive, and conceivably, if enough of the work is done locally you could end up with more privacy — if Amazon is feeling magnanimous.\n\nIt might be weird to think of it this way, but the security and privacy features of an iPhone are well accepted as an example of edge computing. Simply by doing encryption and storing biometric information on the device, Apple offloads a ton of security concerns from the centralized cloud to its diasporic users’ devices.\n\nBut the other reason this feels like edge computing to me, not personal computing, is because while the compute work is distributed, the definition of the compute work is managed centrally. You didn’t have to cobble together the hardware, software, and security best practices to keep your iPhone secure. You just paid $999 at the cellphone store and trained it to recognize your face.\n\nThe management aspect of edge computing is hugely important for security. Think of how much pain and suffering consumers have experienced with poorly managed Internet of Things devices.\n\nThat’s why Microsoft is working on Azure Sphere, which is a managed Linux OS, a certified microcontroller, and a cloud service. The idea is that your toaster should be as difficult to hack, and as centrally updated and managed, as your Xbox.\n\nI have no idea if the industry will embrace Microsoft’s specific solution to the IoT security problem, but it seems an easy guess that most of the hardware you buy a few years from now will have its software updated automatically and security managed centrally. Because otherwise your toaster and dishwasher will join a botnet and ruin your life.\n\nIf you doubt me, just look at the success Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla have had in moving browsers to an “evergreen” model.\n\nThink about it: you could probably tell me which version of Windows you’re running. But do you know which version of Chrome you have? Edge computing will be more like Chrome, less like Windows.\n\nSecurity isn’t the only way that edge computing will help solve the problems IoT introduced. The other hot example I see mentioned a lot by edge proponents is the bandwidth savings enabled by edge computing.\n\nFor instance, if you buy one security camera, you can probably stream all of its footage to the cloud. If you buy a dozen security cameras, you have a bandwidth problem. But if the cameras are smart enough to only save the “important” footage and discard the rest, your internet pipes are saved.\n\nAlmost any technology that’s applicable to the latency problem is applicable to the bandwidth problem. Running AI on a user’s device instead of all in the cloud seems to be a huge focus for Apple and Google right now.\n\nCompanies will control even more of your life experiences than they do right now\n\nBut Google is also working hard at making even websites more edge-y. Progressive Web Apps typically have offline-first functionality. That means you can open a “website” on your phone without an internet connection, do some work, save your changes locally, and only sync up with the cloud when it’s convenient.\n\nGoogle also is getting smarter at combining local AI features for the purpose of privacy and bandwidth savings. For instance, Google Clips keeps all your data local by default and does its magical AI inference locally. It doesn’t work very well at its stated purpose of capturing cool moments from your life. But, conceptually, it’s quintessential edge computing.\n\nSelf-driving cars are, as far as I’m aware, the ultimate example of edge computing. Due to latency, privacy, and bandwidth, you can’t feed all the numerous sensors of a self-driving car up to the cloud and wait for a response. Your trip can’t survive that kind of latency, and even if it could, the cellular network is too inconsistent to rely on it for this kind of work.\n\nBut cars also represent a full shift away from user responsibility for the software they run on their devices. A self-driving car almost has to be managed centrally. It needs to get updates from the manufacturer automatically, it needs to send processed data back to the cloud to improve the algorithm, and the nightmare scenario of a self-driving car botnet makes the toaster and dishwasher botnet we’ve been worried about look like a Disney movie.\n\nI have some fears about edge computing that are hard to articulate, and possibly unfounded, so I won’t dive into them completely.\n\nBut the big picture is that the companies who do it the best will control even more of your life experiences than they do right now.\n\nWhen the devices in your home and garage are managed by Google Amazon Microsoft Apple, you don’t have to worry about security. You don’t have to worry about updates. You don’t have to worry about functionality. You don’t have to worry about capabilities. You’ll just take what you’re given and use it the best you can.\n\nIn this worst-case world, you wake up in the morning and ask Alexa Siri Cortana Assistant what features your corporate overlords have pushed to your toaster, dishwasher, car, and phone overnight. In the personal computer era you would “install” software. In the edge computing era, you’ll only use it.\n\nIt’s up to the big companies to decide how much control they want to gain over their users’ lives. But, it might also be up to us users to decide if there’s another way to build the future. Yes, it’s kind of a relief to take your hands off the steering wheel and let Larry Page guide you. But what if you don’t like where he’s going?","author":"Paul Miller","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T20:11:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-verge","name":"The Verge"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HkE2o_XS3gAP-vK7g7CeQQNmWcU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9399463/jbareham_170922_2006_0572_01.jpg","digest":"WnbK1tiWnNr/kApm5PsgCA==\n"}

Her mom was a giddy accomplice, ready to hoist the Jamaican flag and scream when she saw her daughter’s face on the arena’s giant screen.\n\nThey thought it a fun and tasteful way to pay tribute to the four years of hard work that Senior had accomplished to get to Friday, and they weren’t the only people who planned ostentatious celebrations among the 10,000 college graduates in gowns and mortarboards last weekend. One graduate did a back flip on the stage. Another proposed to his girlfriend. Many others snapped stage selfies.\n\nMid-pose, an “inappropriately aggressive” marshal at the ceremony grabbed her and pushed offstage as thousands watched and others recorded. Videos of her and other similarly treated black students spent the weekend ricocheting around Twitter.\n\nMany saw more than an over-the-top marshal and a botched attempt to maintain decorum.\n\nJust over 6 percent of the student population at the University of Florida identify as black or African American, according to Forbes. But 100 percent of the students being bodily removed in the worst videos were black, including Senior.\n\n“I was getting ready to do the Usain Bolt pose,” she told The Washington Post. “I tried to do it really fast. I saw the guy coming toward me … and when he pushed me, I almost fell, and I caught myself. But he pushed me so far that I passed the lady’s hand that I was supposed to shake.”\n\nIt happened several times to several people on Friday. Nafeesah Attah, who planned to flash a Delta Sigma Theta sorority hand sign, was pushed so hard her cap fell off as she struggled to maintain balance. Oliver Telusma spent a few seconds in a sort of rotating bear-hug with the unidentified university official.\n\nA short time later, University of Florida President W. Kent Fuchs found himself apologizing, saying school officials were “inappropriately aggressive in rushing students off the stage.”\n\nAttah and Senior said they received personal calls from Fuchs, who apologized and said the university was taking steps to make sure the actions didn’t happen again. The marshal responsible for the action is being investigated, he told them.\n\nFuchs didn’t return a message from The Post seeking comment, although he made a public apology at the next day’s commencement exercises.\n\n[‘I was just reading a book’: Canadian cops called on black man reading C.S. Lewis in his car]\n\nIt was unclear what, if any, disciplinary actions were being taken and what specific steps the university was taking to ensure it didn’t happen again. In  his apology Fuchs did not say why the marshal had treated the students in that manner.\n\nThe students who got the worst of it had mixed emotions about the university president’s response. Senior said Fuchs was gracious when he called her. But his apology didn’t come after she was pushed, she noted, it came after the university was roasted on social media. And Fuchs was sitting on the stage when Senior and the others were hurried across it. He did nothing in the moment, she said.\n\nStudents who had been rushed off the stage insisted the damage was done. They had only one chance to walk across the stage as an undergraduate, and it will forever be a bad memory, they said.\n\nTelusma told ABC News he felt bad for his family, whose “lasting memory, at least for undergrad, will be them watching their son having his back turned toward the audience and being handled like a savage animal.”\n\nAs UF’s very involved commencement website can attest to, institutions of higher learning have to stage-manage large, quasi-public events full of unpredictable people who don’t always follow the rules of decorum. Cellphones go off. So do clothes. Then there is this potty-mouthed graduation fight that happened to the soundtrack of “Pomp \u0026 Circumstance.”\n\nThere is only so much that administrators can do to control — or punish — misbehaving students who are about to walk out of a university for the last time.\n\nAttah told The Post she understood the need for decorum. But she believes her actions were not undecorous or any more extreme than the actions of some white classmates who were not manhandled.\n\n“A lot of people think that it’s very trivial,” Attah said. “It speaks to the bigger and larger issue of race relations in the United States at this time and making sure that black students feel comfortable at these universities. This is the time to highlight black excellence; instead we were treated like criminals at our very own commencement.”\n\nFor Senior, the effects of the marshal’s actions endured long after the graduate hung up her cap and gown. That night, she went out with friends to celebrate one of their last times together before moving onto the next chapter in their lives. But the night was muted, Senior said, because she spent a good chunk of it responding to people criticizing her on Twitter.\n\n“I was not being disrespectful,” she said. “I have home training. My family was there watching. I didn’t push nobody. I didn’t yell at nobody. I was very collected. Now people are making it into this whole different argument. It is just the hidden racism.”\n\n“At this point, you want to call me an animal and say we’re ruining a traditional ceremony,” she said of the critics, some of whom were especially harsh. “I just want to tell those people, ‘You guys are the animals. I’m pretty sure if this was a white [graduate that was manhandled], you would be like, oh no, fire [the marshal], shut down UF.’ ”\n\nTrump questions whether key funding source for historically black colleges is constitutional\n\nTrump expresses ‘unwavering support’ for historically black colleges, after questioning constitutionality of funding source\n\nSenator on Trump’s shortlist to head FBI dropped as speaker at historically black university","author":"https://www.facebook.com/CleveWootson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T19:22:34.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p5EaftmoiCLcUkyjChuSCYffqcI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WGDPTJA2644YVCY6WM335PVNKE.png","digest":"VFAeoUcHD2jbL5TcyCDATg==\n"}

It corresponds with a Department of Justice \"zero-tolerance policy\" for illegal border crossings, under which Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered federal prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against all referrals for illegally crossing the border, as possible.\n\nSessions announced the change and reiterated his agency's policy at an appearance in Arizona on Monday.\n\n\"So, if you cross the border unlawfully, even a first offense, we're going to prosecute you,\" Sessions told a gathering of the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies. \"If you're smuggling a child, we're going to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law. If you don't want your child to be separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally.\"\n\nIn Sessions' prepared remarks, he pledged his department would take up as many of the referrals from DHS \"as humanly possible.\"\n\nThe policy would not apply to asylum seekers who come to an official port of entry to the US without paperwork -- those individuals would only be placed into immigration proceedings.\n\nBut by referring immigrants caught illegally crossing for criminal charges, the move means adults coming across the border with children will be separated from those children as they await their criminal proceedings.\n\nIn one recent example of how the policy works, a woman who is suspected by the Justice Department of being part of the migrant caravan that was caught in a group north of the border was charged with illegal entry to the US and separated from the four young children who were with her. Her lawyers have fought back, accusing the Justice Department of discriminating against her for being Central American.\n\nIt has long been a misdemeanor federal offense to be caught illegally entering the US, punishable by up to six months in prison, but the administration has not always referred everyone caught for prosecution. Those apprehended were swiftly put into immigration proceedings and, unless they met the threshold to pursue a valid asylum claim, can be quickly deported from the country.\n\nThe current DHS plan makes no special arrangements for those who claim asylum when apprehended. While they will be allowed to pursue their claims and could eventually be found to have a legitimate right to live in the US, they could still already have a conviction for illegal entry.\n\nDHS has come under heavy criticism from advocates for allegedly separating families at the border as a deterrence measure and was sued by a Congolese woman seeking asylum who was separated from her young daughter for months, until DNA testing during the court proceedings confirmed their relationship.\n\nThe move comes amid intense attention to the caravan -- an annual journey of mostly women and children fleeing what they say are dangerous situations at home through Mexico to make asylum claims in the US. More than 200 of the migrants were processed for asylum claims at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California last week. Though the caravan in past years has drawn little national attention, President Donald Trump, Sessions and other administration officials have pointed to it in recent weeks as evidence of a crisis at the southern border, where illegal crossings are at historically low levels. The woman's lawyers have used those statements as evidence in her case.\n\nThe Trump administration has made taking an aggressive approach to illegal immigration a top priority. According to the Homeland Security official, the department this fiscal year has already referred 30,005 illegal entry cases to the Department of Justice, a 61% increase from fiscal year 2017, even before the policy took effect.\n\nThere were roughly 38,000 people caught trying to illegally cross the southern border each of the past two months, with the numbers ranging from 25,000 to 29,000 in the winter months. Roughly 5,000 to nearly 10,000 families per month were part of that total.\n\nA similar effort to prosecute all illegal entries in certain high-volume sectors of the border was put in place under the Bush administration, known as \"Operation Streamline.\"\n\nSupporters of the program credited it with reducing the number of crossings and repeat offenders, while critics said it overwhelmed the courts and US attorneys offices with low-level crimes that made it difficult to use resources to go after serious and dangerous crime like drug smuggling and cartels.\n\nThe inspector general report did note that prosecuting immigrants before they were allowed to pursue their asylum claims could run afoul of international treaty obligations and urged Customs and Border Protection to come up with specific policies for that situation.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story's headline misstated the agency that would prosecute those who cross the border illegally.","author":"Tal Kopan, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T18:52:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180429143730-05-migrant-caravan-0429-super-tease.jpg","digest":"TdBv2BDuXYv5kTzE78UnKQ==\n"}

The former president was visiting Ethiopia to foster peace talks between the government and Eritrean rebels and urgently needed to get word to a local guerrilla leader that he had to cancel their planned meeting. Learning that Haspel worked for the CIA, Carter asked to meet her after an official dinner they’d both attended and requested that she relay his message.\n\nHaspel used her contacts to successfully deliver the message through a back channel. The episode, described by people familiar with Haspel’s career, was one of several clandestine assignments that left the young Kentuckian feeling as if she had entered a life “right out of a spy novel,” as Haspel recalled three decades later.\n\nOn Wednesday, she faces an entirely different assignment, one she surely never expected — persuading the U.S. Senate to support her nomination as the next director of the CIA. Haspel’s chances of winning confirmation are considered uncertain, in part because Republicans hold only a slim majority and not all GOP senators have pledged to vote for her. On Monday, she called on senators, while the administration said it would share more classified information with lawmakers about Haspel’s career.\n\nHaspel is one of a few career intelligence officers to be tapped for director, and the first woman. She also has the most secretive résumé. Nearly every one of her 33 years in the CIA was spent undercover, and only in recent days has the agency revealed the dates and nature of some of her assignments, as part of an unusual public relations campaign to secure Haspel’s confirmation.\n\nBut her success is not guaranteed and could hinge on one chapter in her mysterious career: Haspel’s role in the CIA’s controversial program of detaining and interrogating suspected terrorists. On Friday, Haspel’s nomination was nearly derailed when she offered to withdraw rather than face a bruising public debate over the program that she feared could damage the agency and her reputation, according to four administration officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. White House officials ultimately persuaded her not to drop out.\n\nIn 2002, Haspel oversaw a secret CIA detention facility in Thailand where interrogators waterboarded two al-Qaeda suspects — Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, better known by the nom de guerre Abu Zubaida, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. (Abu Zubaida was interrogated before Haspel took charge of the site.) Later, while serving in a powerful senior position at CIA headquarters, Haspel argued for destroying nearly 100 videotapes that recorded the interrogation sessions. Haspel worried the tapes could become public and expose the interrogators, whose faces were clearly visible, to reprisal attacks by terrorists, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn 2005, at the direction of Haspel’s boss Jose Rodriguez, the director of the National Clandestine Service, CIA employees fed the tapes into a shredding machine.\n\nSenior CIA and George W. Bush administration officials shared Haspel’s concern for agency personnel and their families. But they expected the White House to give a final sign-off on destroying the tapes before any action was taken. Rodriguez did not tell CIA leaders or the White House before issuing the order, though the destruction had been discussed among top officials for years.\n\nSenators and staffers then with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which will hear Haspel’s testimony this week, were livid. “It was just brazen. It really was to me a violation of norms and the rule of law in many ways,” said Todd Rosenblum, a former committee staff member. He said the tapes should have been preserved for the panel’s examination of the interrogation program. An internal CIA review cleared Haspel of any wrongdoing in the destruction of the tapes.\n\nCurrent committee members have said that other “disturbing” facts in Haspel’s record need to be declassified for the public to take the full measure of the nominee. Critics charge the CIA with selectively declassifying the most anodyne and flattering moments of Haspel’s work — including a two-page biographical statement in which she fondly recalled her time in Ethiopia without actually naming the country.\n\n“Concealing her background when no sources and methods are at stake shows nothing but contempt for the Senate and the public,” Intelligence Committee Democrats Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Martin Heinrich (N.M.) said in a joint statement last month.\n\nIn interviews with 15 current and former intelligence officials, including some who worked closely with Haspel, a portrait of her cloak-and-dagger life emerged. Straddling the twilight of the Cold War and the dawn of a global campaign against terrorism, Haspel, 61, finds herself poised to take over an agency that is returning its focus to traditional state adversaries, including China, North Korea, Iran and Russia — a country Haspel has studied especially closely.\n\nHaspel, who was born in Kentucky but spent her childhood living on military bases overseas, joined the CIA in 1985 as a trainee in the Directorate of Operations, the espionage branch that recruits and handles spies in foreign countries. She is not married and has no children, and friends say she has effectively dedicated her whole life to the CIA.\n\nTwo years after she joined the agency, she was given her first assignment in Ethi­o­pia, then a major beneficiary of Soviet aide.\n\n“She started as a boots-on-the-ground field officer,” said a retired senior CIA officer who is a friend of Haspel’s. She met agents, collected intelligence. “She’s got grass stains because she played in the field.”\n\nAfter two years in Ethiopia, Haspel enrolled in a year of Turkish language training. She had studied languages at college in Kentucky and majored in journalism, although her school newspaper has no records showing she ever wrote articles.\n\nIn 1990, she was assigned as a case officer in Ankara, Turkey, according to people familiar with her early career. She spent three years there, amid the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe early work was not glamorous, but it raised Haspel’s stock. “If you study a hard language and go to a hard place, then your credibility among the ranks immediately goes up,” said Henry “Hank” Crumpton, who years later hired Haspel as his deputy when he ran the CIA’s national resources division, which gathers intelligence in the United States by talking to people who have traveled to countries the agency wants to know more about.\n\n[A woman atop the CIA was once unthinkable. But female spies have always been remarkable.]\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union was no more, Haspel’s interest in Russia and the former Soviet republics intensified. So did her study of Russian tradecraft, said former CIA officers who know her. Haspel became a student of Moscow’s methods for recruiting agents and secretly communicating with them. One of her favorite TV shows is “The Americans,” Haspel’s friend said, because it accurately portrays Russian espionage in the 1980s.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1998, while she was serving as chief of the CIA’s station in Baku, Azerbaijan, Haspel’s career took a turn. Al-Qaeda launched simultaneous bombings against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. A few days later, Haspel received a middle-of-the-night call summoning her to the office, where she learned that two senior al-Qaeda associates linked to the bombings were heading to the former Soviet republic, according to an administration official familiar with Haspel’s career.\n\nWorking with Azerbaijan’s KGB-trained intelligence service, Haspel organized an operation to intercept the men. Although they never stood trial in the United States, the CIA credits the operation with retrieving valuable information from the men’s computers about a separate al-Qaeda plot. Haspel won a CIA award for her work.\n\nThe embassy bombings were the clearest signal yet to the U.S. intelligence community that al-Qaeda intended to inflict massive damage on American targets. Haspel continued working for the next two years on operations against Russia, and then served for a year as a deputy chief of station in the CIA’s Europe division. In 2001, she requested a transfer to the agency’s Counterterrorism Center. Her first day on the job was Sept. 11.\n\nSuddenly, the CIA confronted a new enemy that organized itself into loosely connected networks, not along bureaucratic hierarchies like state adversaries. Intelligence officials worried that it would take years for the CIA to learn how to penetrate al-Qaeda. With the Soviets vanquished, the United States had slashed spending on intelligence and droves of CIA officers had retired.\n\n“By 9/11, we were gutted,” said Daniel Hoffman, a 30-year veteran who worked with Haspel at CIA headquarters.\n\nHaspel was well known in the Directorate of Operations for her work against Russia and her honed tradecraft. She was someone who knew how to find people inside organizations, identify their vulnerabilities and learn who was connected to whom.\n\nHoffman and others credit Haspel for putting that knowledge to work after 9/11 and helping to establish the CIA’s early approach to understanding al-Qaeda’s structure and identifying its members.\n\n“She was present at the creation” of a new era for the CIA, Hoffman said.\n\nBut the CIA also embarked upon operations for which it had never trained its officers — capturing terrorists and holding and interrogating them in secret detention facilities. By the time Haspel arrived to run the facility in Thailand, one detainee, Abu Zubaida, had already been subjected to some of the harshest interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, approved by CIA and administration leaders and lawyers, above Haspel’s rank. Members of Congress had also been briefed on the program.\n\nHaspel apparently was not made aware of the agency’s use of “enhanced” interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, widely regarded as torture, until shortly before she arrived at the detention facility, according to public records and people with knowledge of her time there.\n\nBut Haspel was surely aware that interrogations were providing information about al-Qaeda. Some officials said that internal documents and CIA cables show Haspel was an enthusiastic supporter of the program. Haspel is not expected to deny that she believed detainees provided valuable information. But she may take pains to distance herself from the decisions to implement the program in the first place, according to U.S. officials.\n\n“She wasn’t the architect of the program, by no means,” said Michael Sulick, the director of the National Clandestine Service from 2007 to 2010.\n\nHaspel was, however, a leading advocate for destroying the tapes. She did not give the order, in 2005, but she lobbied senior CIA officials and drafted a cable for Rodriguez, ordering field officers to destroy the material. Haspel believed that Rodriguez was going to first get the approval of CIA leaders before giving the order, but he did not, according to people with knowledge of the events.\n\n“To say that she was part of this [detention and interrogation] program, from a management standpoint, and is not qualified to lead the agency, is misguided,” said John Brennan, who served as CIA director under President Barack Obama.\n\nBrennan joined 52 other former senior national security officials in signing a letter of support for Haspel’s nomination, calling her a “true intelligence professional who brings care, integrity and a commitment to the rule of law to her work every day.”\n\nBut more than twice as many retired military generals signed a letter opposing Haspel. “We do not accept efforts to excuse her actions relating to torture and other unlawful abuse of detainees by offering that she was ‘just following orders,’ ” they wrote.\n\nHaspel’s role in the interrogation program did not impede her rise within the CIA’s power structure. She held several senior leadership positions, including chief of staff to Rodriquez.\n\nIn 2008, she received a plum job in England, the United States’ closest intelligence ally — chief of station in London. For Haspel, an Anglophile and devourer of British mystery series, the posting was particularly satisfying, those who know her said. It also signaled to the CIA workforce that she was destined for top leadership.\n\nMore senior posts followed, including deputy director of the National Clandestine Service, as the Directorate of Operations was then known, from 2012 to 2014. That year, Haspel went back to London and remained until 2017, when she was tapped as deputy director of the CIA.\n\nHaspel’s presence back at headquarters helped to ease anxieties among CIA employees, many of whom regarded the new director, Republican former congressman Mike Pompeo, as a ruthless partisan sent in by a president who was overtly hostile to intelligence officers, comparing them during the transition to Nazis and accusing them of trying to delegitimize his election.\n\nWhile Pompeo nurtured his relationship with President Trump, Haspel was put in charge of most of the day-to-day operations of the agency. She also became a trusted partner to Pompeo and a key player paving a path toward a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Those efforts culminated in a secret meeting between Pompeo and Kim in Pyongyang over the Easter weekend, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\nHaspel has spent some time with Trump in briefings, though they are not as close as the president and Pompeo, people with knowledge of Haspel’s interactions said. She has staked out a tough position on Russia that runs contrary to many of the president’s positions and instincts. In response to Russia’s alleged use of a nerve agent in England in March, Haspel helped coordinate the expulsion of Russian diplomats by U.S. allies around the world, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThose who know Haspel well said they had no doubt she would be candid with Trump on matters that might put the two at odds — including torture. Trump has spoken in favor of the use of torture. On Wednesday, Haspel is expected to say she would not favor reinstating the “enhanced” interrogation program, in any form, according to people familiar with her planned testimony.\n\nBrennan, who has gone head-to-head with Trump in Twitter feuds, said, “I have great confidence that Gina Haspel has the requisite background and the professional credentials to be able to speak truth to power, irrespective of the policy druthers of the person in the Oval Office.”\n\nJulie Tate in Washington and Jim Higdon in Lexington and Louisville contributed to this report.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T18:41:26.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u2C1yma5nVQ58uJ_lmTyoKcImgg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQRKLJCPAYI6RL2GWHLNYDM37Y.jpg","digest":"j2me7U/dEvjhfofjl2+mZw==\n"}

Multiple sources, including Fox News, have claimed that Cruz was in the program or at least benefited from it despite the district’s denials.\n\nBroward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie has previously said Cruz was not part of the program. The Sun Sentinel’s Scott Travis reports that, despite being referred to the program, Cruz never participated:\n\nRyan Petty, who lost his daughter Alaina in the shooting, took to Twitter to lambaste the district:\n\nBut Petty, who is now a member of a state-sanctioned commission looking into the shooting, said that it was important to consider not just Promise, but the totality of the district’s programs targeting youth offenders.\n\n“The intentions of the program are likely quite good. The challenge is in the actual implementation. It’s clear to me after talking with several teachers, principals and administrators that the combination of these programs are confusing to implement,” he said. “There is a balance to be struck and clearly in Broward County we’ve missed that balance point.”\n\nAside from the efficacy, the school district’s denial that Cruz had any connection to the Promise program raises serious questions. Were school district officials unaware that Cruz was referred to the program when he was in middle school? This seems unlikely. Are the program’s harshest critics in conservative media correct in claiming that the district is using the program to cover up high crime rates in Broward schools, or was the district trying to protect a program that they believe is working to keep kids out of jail?\n\n“It would seem the district is more concerned about protecting programs than students and teachers,” Petty said.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the program, which only covers about a dozen misdemeanor crimes, would not have prevented Cruz from buying a gun. And that, prior to the program, the Broward County School District saw far more arrests for minor crimes than any other county in the state, including Miami-Dade.\n\nWe want to know what you think: Should school children be arrested by school resource officers for committing misdemeanors on campus? What about the racial disparities that were part of the reason for the program’s creation in the first place?\n\nIf the Promise program isn’t working to keep schools safe while also providing a second chance or troubled kids, then what will?\n\nEmail dsweeney@SunSentinel.com, tweet @Daniel_Sweeney or comment below.

Some were almost looking to her for absolution, she believes.\n\n\"I think after my loss - which was such a surprise to everyone including I think the other campaign - [women] now understand what's at stake. Part of my problem is everybody thought I was going to win. Everybody. Maybe there were one or two outliers who didn't think that but the vast majority of public opinion polling opinion research pointed to my winning and, of course, I won the popular vote by a significant margin. I got more votes than anybody who ever ran for president other than (former US President Barack Obama).\n\n\"So I think people got complacent, particularly young women. We have trouble getting young people to vote anyway. I think a lot of young people including young women, thought 'well she was going to win anyway'. They didn't make the effort and it turned out the way it did.\"\n\nClinton's book was written when she still carried the wounds of an ugly and divisive US election campaign.\n\n\"It really was hard but I had to do it. I felt such an urgency to try and get straight in my own mind what I thought happened and there were so many people come up to me and basically ask the question, endlessly…..'what happened?. And I wasn't sure.\n\n\"I thought I had a couple of answers but I dove into it and it was a cathartic experience but it was also, it turns out, somewhat important to lay out the various forces and factors that [existed] in our campaign at that time.

But since then, some conservatives have quietly pushed for an even bolder proposal, particularly after the GOP’s spending binge in recent months, those Republicans said.\n\nThe White House initially floated as much as $60 billion in cuts, including an unprecedented attempt to cancel money from this year’s omnibus spending bill. The proposal was later downsized to $11 billion, targeting only unused funding from past years.\n\nThe administration will still send the request to Capitol Hill this week, but it will no longer be sent Monday, as had earlier been predicted. Now, the package is expected as early as Tuesday, those familiar with the plan said.\n\nIn a concession to some GOP leaders, the White House will no longer go after spending from this year’s omnibus bill which was painstakingly negotiated between both parties.\n\nInstead, the $15 billion will come from years-old programs where there is still unspent money.\n\nThe request is expected to target accounts going back at least a decade, including leftover money from Obama-era programs like the 2009 stimulus, the health care law and the U.S. fight against the Ebola virus.\n\nThe process also includes a special bonus for fiscal hawks: Whenever the president submits a rescissions request, that spending is frozen automatically for 45 legislative days, or until Congress formally rejects it.\n\nOMB Director Mick Mulvaney said in April that he hopes for a vote in the House before the July Fourth recess.\n\nBut even with a 51-vote threshold, many on Capitol Hill doubt whether the narrowly divided Senate will sign off on the spending cuts.\n\nThe GOP-dominated House is expected to easily clear the rescissions package, but even White House officials are less confident about its fate in the Senate, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told POLITICO on Monday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pleased with the $15 billion proposal, Short said. It’s the biggest single package “ever put forward to Congress,” he noted.\n\nTrump’s unusually large request would come after a nearly two-decade drought of any formal rescissions proposal. That means few lawmakers in Congress have ever dealt with one before, leaving even key chairmen scrambling to learn the details.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was the last president to propose rescissions. His three requests totaled just $128 million, a fraction of Trump’s request.\n\nEven with Trump’s record-setting sum, conservative groups are demanding the Trump administration go further by proposing to cancel funds from the omnibus, which Trump threatened to veto.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, the right-leaning group founded by the Koch brothers, is asking the White House to reel back $45 billion from the $1.3 trillion omnibus.\n\nThe group on Monday released an exhaustive list of programs it believes should go on the chopping block, including homeless assistance grants, a Coast Guard security center, FBI salaries and the National Cancer Institute.\n\nBehind the scenes, top budget officials have wrestled for weeks with Republican lawmakers on the size and scope of the rescissions package.\n\nThe debate was largely centered on whether to cut money across the board from the omnibus spending package, or whether to target individual programs.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the across-the-board cuts as those would have hit the hard-won increases to military spending. But officials also worried that going after specific programs would spur infighting among Republicans, according to one former top GOP congressional aide briefed on the deliberations — an outcome everyone hoped to avoid ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, belt-tightening conservatives in the House are still hoping for more than $15 billion in cuts.\n\nAn internal survey of dozens of House Republican Study Committee members found that lawmakers overwhelmingly support the largest possible rescissions request. The survey, which was obtained by POLITICO, found that 71 percent of RSC members said they would back a proposal that cut at least $60 billion. Another 9 percent said they'd support any amount.\n\nAnd 94 percent of RSC members surveyed said the rescissions package should cut at least some domestic funding from this year's $1.3 trillion omnibus. Only 6 percent said \"maybe.\"\n\nRepublican budget wonks also wondered if the final package would accomplish the task of reducing government spending in a meaningful way, if it indeed took previously unspent money from old programs.\n\n“This is not a deficit reduction exercise, but more of a public relations exercise to soothe the base and convince them that the White House is fiscally responsible,” said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former director of budget and appropriations for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist as well as the former director of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\n“If they are finding unused budget authority and putting that in a special package to Congress as appropriators are trying to put together the [fiscal] 2019 bill, it may have the effect of creating more spending for 2019 rather than less,” Hoagland said.\n\nAdministration officials, including Mulvaney, have stressed that this week’s package is only the first of many.\n\nMultiple past presidents have proposed dozens of separate rescission packages. Former President Ronald Reagan, who holds the current record, asked Congress for 602 rescissions totaling $43 billion.\n\nNancy Cook, John Bresnahan and Matthew Nussbaum contributed to this report.","author":"SARAH FERRIS","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T21:22:30.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/70/c9/75cdd2c145d99b8fed0827d239eb/25-donald-trump-42-gty-1160.jpg","digest":"tGJy3keKXazqwseTS3r+Hw==\n"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5af0cf835a90676be2aa37a5"},"description":"","title":"Here's How the 2018 Midterm Elections Could Affect Robert Mueller's Investigation","url":"http://time.com/5268114/robert-mueller-donald-trump-midterm-elections-protocol/","text":"President Donald Trump is already arguing that the Russia investigation might “wrongfully” affect the 2018 midterm elections, but legal experts say that even if Mueller halts some announcements in the month preceding the elections, his investigation will continue.\n\nIn a tweet Monday morning, Trump argued that that former FBI Director Robert Mueller’s investigation could “go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended.”\n\nTypically, employees of the Department of Justice refrain from making any major decisions in investigations in the immediate weeks preceding an election, but legal experts and former prosecutors say Mueller’s investigation is anything but typical.\n\nWhile they anticipate that Mueller will stick with longstanding agency protocol and not issue any indictments in the month leading up to the November elections, they also don’t think it will dramatically slow down his investigation.\n\n“Ninety-nine percent of his work has been done under the surface; the only time we hear from Bob Mueller is when he has something to say in court,” said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. Attorney who served as counselor to Mueller and chief of staff to former FBI Director James Comey. “Respecting the general rule in not interfering in an election will have no effect on his investigation. From his perspective, it will be business as usual.”\n\nIronically, Trump himself benefited from a violation of this norm in 2016. Many Democrats argue that Comey’s decision to send a letter to Congress that he was looking into Hillary Clinton’s emails on Oct. 28 — 11 days before the presidential election — essentially cost her the election, and there is evidence that it may have proven decisive in key states.\n\nBut there is no actual law barring Justice employees from making major decisions until after an election.\n\n“Department of Justice employees are entrusted with the authority to enforce the laws of the United States and with the responsibility to do so in a neutral and impartial manner. This is particularly important in an election year,” then-Attorney General Eric Holder wrote in a memo to DOJ employees in March of 2012 “Simply put, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations.”\n\nEmployees typically receive a memo similar to Holder’s during a presidential election year; the last one issued was in 2016. But the memos do not typically lay out guidelines or timelines for when employees should stop issuing any decisions. In Holder’s memo, for instance, he told employees that if they had questions they should contact the Public Integrity Section of the criminal division.\n\n“You’ll notice, [the memo] doesn’t really say what the right thing to do is,” said Barbara McQuade, who served as former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan during the Obama administration. “It doesn’t say don’t file indictments, or don’t investigate, it just says consult with the public integrity section and think things through.”\n\nBut despite the lack of specificity, the backlash when employees appear to violate the protocol laid out in Holder’s memo can be fierce – like the intense scrutiny Comey found himself under. That’s why experts deem it highly any major bombshells from the investigation will drop within 30 days before the November election.\n\nBut, they caution, comparing Comey’s decision with Mueller’s investigation is not necessarily a fair comparison. (“Its like comparing apples and oranges,” said one former U.S. attorney). Clinton was actually on the ballot at the time. Trump is not – and neither are any of the nearly 20people who have been indicted or pled guilty in the Mueller investigation so far.\n\n“None of the indictments we’ve seen so far strike me as the type that would be too politically sensitive to be filed too close to an election. Especially an election in which the President is not on the ballot,” said Eric Columbus, who worked as an attorney in the DOJ during the Obama Administration. “Those are not indictments that suggest guilt by the President or anyone close to him. If Mueller is continuing to indict people in that way, then I don’t think there’s much concern regarding the proximity of the election.”\n\nColumbus said the situation would be different if Mueller decided to indict a close Trump associate, and that indictment directly implicated the President in something. At that point, he said, Mueller would probably be reluctant to announce that too close to the election. But he did say former Trump campaign head Paul Manafort’s trial on charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, which is scheduled for July, will likely be able to proceed without allegations of election interference.\n\nAnd all experts were in agreement that Mueller’s teams work would continue in that month leading up to the midterms, even if he potentially held off on major announcements.\n\n“I don’t think it’s going to affect his timeframe. I think he’s probably moving as rapidly as he can,” said Peter Zeidenberg, who was deputy special counsel in the Scooter Libby case and worked with Mueller at the Justice Department. “He’s moved very quickly so far. I don’t think that’s going to slow down, and I don’t think it’s going to stop except for maybe that small window right before the midterms, when he may want to hold off on issuing anything. That’s about it.”","author":"Alana Abramson","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T21:17:37.000Z"},"source":{"id":"time","name":"Time"},"urlToImage":"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-699394014.jpg?quality=85","digest":"Uq1qa4DUmfC3Kc4bwsDVCw==\n"}

Because its strategy of defensiveness and stalemate has worked well so far.","title":"The Logic of the NRA Choosing Ollie North as President","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/ollie-north-nra-double-down/559823/","text":"Why would the group select the Iran-Contra figure as its new leader? Because its strategy of defensiveness and stalemate has worked well so far.\n\nSometimes it feels as though the current moment in American history is unique. At other times, there’s a disquieting déjà vu—for example, this week, when both Daniel Ortega, the Nicaragua Sandinista leader, and Ollie North, the American Marine who funneled weapons to his right-wing opponents the Contras, are both in the news. Ortega, now president once again, is holding on for bare political life amid protests in his country. North, it turns out, is about to take over another controversial, oft-protested body: The National Rifle Association announced Monday that North will be its next president. From a certain angle, North’s ascension is a peculiar choice for the NRA, both given the current political moment and given North’s own history. North came to national prominence in the Iran-Contra affair, in which the U.S. illegally sold weapons to Iran—violating an arms embargo—then funneled the proceeds to the Contras, who were fighting Ortega’s left-wing government. North, a Vietnam veteran, was then a lieutenant colonel serving on the National Security Council. He was charged with various felonies related to Iran-Contra and convicted of three. The New York Times editorial board tartly panned his verdict: “Oliver North won’t go to prison even though he lied to Congress, shredded White House documents and accepted a $14,000 security fence from an Iran-contra arms profiteer.” As it turned out, North’s convictions were reversed and vacated altogether because a judge ruled that the prosecution had used testimony North offered Congress under an immunity agreement. In 1994, North ran for U.S. Senate in Virginia, where he proved a formidable fundraiser but a divisive candidate, and lost to incumbent Chuck Robb, helped by a third-party candidate who was endorsed by Senator John Warner, a Republican. Since then, he’s been active in conservative activist circles.\n\nNorth’s appointment spawned an immediate round of very similar jokes—he’s a perfect fit for the NRA, since he’s got lots of experience facilitating gun sales, har har har—as well as some consternation at why the NRA would choose an obviously tarnished figure like North, especially at a moment when the organization is under even more political pressure than usual following the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the aftermath of which has launched the largest protest movement for gun restrictions in years. The NRA’s éminence grise is Wayne LaPierre, its longtime executive vice president, while the presidency is a more ceremonial post. Still, the group hasn’t shied away from controversial presidents in the past. The most notable in recent memory is Charlton Heston, who served for five years and delivered the famous quip that Al Gore could have his gun when he took it “from my cold, dead hands.” A more recent president, Jim Porter, called Barack Obama a “fake president” and referred to the Civil War as the “War of Northern Aggression.” (The NRA’s first president, Ambrose Burnside, led troops in the Union Army against the treasonous rebellion.) This is not merely chance. Warning about gun-grabbers riles up NRA members. As I wrote in February, after a LaPierre stemwinder full of controversial and dubious points just days after Parkland, it’s a consistent strategy for the group. LaPierre does something like this almost every year, setting off a predictable cycle: People get outraged; someone says LaPierre has gone too far; but LaPierre holds up the backlash against him as proof that they (the media, the government, whomever) is out for their guns and rallies the base with it. LaPierre has recognized that in these post-violence moments, in which there are new calls for gun control, all the NRA needs to do is maintain the status quo. A vocal and energized minority of the population is sufficient to do that, even though vast majorities of Americans support at least some minor forms of gun control, like stricter background checks. The NRA pursues a similarly provocative strategy in its online messaging, most recently in the person of spokeswoman Dana Loesch.\n\nNorth, as a veteran culture warrior, is perfectly fitted to this strategy. Because of his Iran-Contra connections, he also makes for a perfect Trump-era martyr. His champions viewed him as a victim of the deep state, long before anyone in the U.S. used the phrase, and of a special prosecutor overstepping his bounds. After Parkland, it seemed like the seemingly unshakeable stalemate on gun laws was trembling. The power of the Parkland students as advocates for stricter gun laws is remarkable, but so far they have few concrete victories to point to, and their staying power is unknown. In March, Florida added a few new gun regulations that the NRA opposed, but the changes are modest, and also included an NRA-backed idea to allow teachers to carry guns. Days after LaPierre’s comments in Florida, President Trump demanded stronger gun-control laws, suggested taking guns from people without due process, and mocked lawmakers for being afraid of the NRA. But the president quickly backed off those comments and hasn’t continued to push for controls. He did, however, appear at the NRA convention in Dallas last week, as did Vice President Pence. At the moment, LaPierre’s post-Parkland strategy seems to have worked. The NRA has found its true north in provocation, so it’s only logical they’d find Ollie North, too.","author":"David A.

This particular episode  began late Thursday afternoon in Leilani Estates, a subdivision near the quaint town of Pahoa and 30 minutes south of Hilo.\n\nMore: On Hawaii's Big Island: Near Volcano Kilauea, life 'normal for none of us'; elsewhere, business as usual\n\nWhy is it erupting now? \"We don't know enough details about the internal plumbing to be able to give really precise answers to this question,\" said Tracy Gregg, an associate professor of geology at the University at Buffalo. \"The short answer is that a blob of new magma from deep below the volcano got injected up into the volcanic edifice.\n\n\"That, combined with the general instability of Kilauea volcano in general, has allowed the magma to erupt near Leilani Estates,\" she said. The southeast flank of the volcano is unstable and will fall into the ocean someday, and as it slowly tears away from the rest of the volcano, it leaves an easy subterranean pathway for the magma to travel.\n\nHow long will the episode last?  “There’s more magma (underground lava) in the system to be erupted. As long as that supply is there, the eruption will continue,” U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Wendy Stovall said.\n\nIn short: This eruption could be nearly finished or could go on for a long time.\n\nWhat are the dangers? At temperatures of more than 2,000 degrees, lava is one of the primary hazards of volcanoes.\n\nAs lava oozes down steep slopes, it often breaks apart into a billowing avalanche of hot rock and gas called a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic flows destroy anything in their path. In 1902, a pyroclastic flow from Mount Pelée on Martinique killed 30,000 people in the nearby town of St. Pierre in two minutes.\n\nLava flows have damaged areas around Kilauea for decades. Flows destroyed a visitor center at Kilauea in 1989 and overran the village of Kalapana on the volcano's southeast flank in 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey said.\n\nWho is at risk from the gases? Kilauea produces sulfuric dioxide. If there's a lot of sulfur blown consistently in the same direction, it can kill plants and cause respiratory failure in people — as well as etch eyeglasses or car windows, Gregg said. As is typical in Hawaii, winds have blown primarily from the east during the eruption, spreading the foul air as far as 60 miles across the southern part of the island.\n\nKilauea is a shield volcano. What does that mean? A  shield volcano is one that is broad and domed with sloping sides made up of runny, gas-poor lava that doesn't explode.\n\nThat's in contrast to volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens, which are made up of thick, sticky, gas-rich lava that explodes, making ash.\n\nIs this the world's longest-erupting volcano? No. There are submarine volcanoes along Earth's mid-ocean ridges that have been erupting longer. Each of the Hawaiian volcanoes tends to be active for about a million years or so before going extinct.\n\nMore: Hawaii volcano has community under siege from lava flow: Here's what we know\n\nIs Hawaii accustomed to volcanic eruptions? Because they were formed by volcanic activity, the Hawaiian islands are no stranger to eruptions. Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea are two other huge volcanoes on the Big Island. On Maui, the volcano Haleakala makes up 75% of the island.\n\nThe deadliest Hawaiian eruption in recent history was in 1790 when 400 people were killed during an eruption of Kilauea. One of the more spectacular recent ones was in 1983, when Mauna Loa erupted, spewing lava hundreds of feet in the air.\n\nHow common are volcanoes? The USA and its territories contain 169 geologically active volcanoes, of which 54 are a very high or high threat to public safety, the U.S. Geological Survey said.\n\nThere are about 1,500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide, not including volcanoes on the ocean floor.","author":"Doyle Rice","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T20:28:57.000Z"},"source":{"id":"usa-today","name":"USA Today"},"urlToImage":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4bc3fd15d28bf8efeb33e9b5d7090b5e5e04fb8/c=0-261-2814-1851\u0026r=x1683\u0026c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636612120307189902-USP-News--Hawaii-Volcano.2.jpg","digest":"2iubrXPm/dT+6n1VT7wSiQ==\n"}

There is no evidence that she has ever testified in public before, and she will almost certainly face bruising questions about the extent of her involvement in the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” now widely considered torture.\n\nThe public grilling she’s certain to face appears to have given Haspel second thoughts about moving forward. She reportedly went to the White House Friday with the intention of withdrawing her nomination, citing the potential damage to the CIA’s reputation, and had to be talked out of it.\n\nHow much Haspel will choose to say in her testimony remains an open question. As current acting director, Haspel is the classification authority over her own record — something her Democratic critics have described as a conflict.

(McCain was far from a certain vote for Haspel. He was tortured while a prisoner of war in Vietnam and has pressed her on her role in the CIA program.)\n\nYet Manchin appeared positive about Haspel following his meeting on Monday, telling The Hill that it went “extremely well” and that he remains “very open-minded” about her nomination.\n\n“She’s truly a professional,” he said, calling her “very direct and very knowledgeable.”\n\n“I think the whole thing is, in this meeting here, wait to see what my other colleagues have to add.”\n\nSen.

But on Monday he blasted the CIA for a “lack of transparency,” calling it “unacceptable,” according to a letter to the agency first reported by CNN.\n\nAlthough there is no public evidence that Haspel participated directly in interrogations, she briefly ran a “black site” prison in Thailand in 2002 during a period in which the USS Cole bombing suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was waterboarded three times.\n\nHaspel will also almost certainly be pressed on her role in the destruction of videotapes documenting the interrogations of both al-Nashiri and another al Qaeda suspect held at the prison, Abu Zubaydah.\n\nJose Rodriguez, then head of the agency’s clandestine service, ordered the destruction of the tapes, but Haspel drafted the cable issuing the command. The move came amid growing scrutiny of the George W. Bush administration’s detention and interrogation program.\n\nAn internal review conducted by then-CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell found no fault with Haspel. A separate federal investigation did not result in charges, a decision that baffled many torture experts.\n\nIt remains unknown how much detail the CIA provided lawmakers in the files delivered on Monday. A CIA spokesperson said that the documents “cover the entirety of her career, including her time in CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center in the years after 9/11.”\n\nHeinrich, Feinstein and Sen.

He said he had breakfast and lunch with Trump at his Northern Virginia country club on Sunday, sitting down before and after the president played a round of golf to talk about their Russia strategy. (Giuliani said he didn’t play because he’s nursing a groin injury.)\n\n“He moves so fast, I probably would have strained it some more,” Giuliani said of the president.\n\nAs for the interview, Trump is still hoping for a negotiated settlement with Mueller that leads to a face-to-face meeting, Giuliani said.\n\n“I think the president would like that,” he said. “The question is, would his lawyers?”\n\nAt issue, according to Giuliani, are several disputes with Mueller, including over just how detailed the special counsel would be with his questioning. The president’s legal team also wants to see the Justice Department produce internal records relating to the scope of Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\n“We haven’t been given it. We’ve never seen it,” Giuliani said.\n\nThe Justice Department memo is already the source of controversy, and Trump last week suggested that he might intervene to get the classified records delivered to Congress. “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn the interview, Giuliani said the Trump legal team had concluded that Mueller would follow longstanding department practice that a sitting president can’t be indicted. “All he could do is write a report,” Giuliani said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week two Justice Department opinions on the indictment topic — written during Watergate and after the Monica Lewinsky scandal — when asked whether a president while still in office could face charges for crimes committed while in office. But Rosenstein, who has the primary oversight function in Mueller’s investigation because of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal, did not explicitly endorse that legal view.\n\nHis nonreply added fuel to a over whether the Mueller investigation could even seek a second opinion on the question.\n\nGiuliani argued that Mueller would be “violating the rules of the Justice Department that he’s bound by” if he asked for a new analysis.\n\n“We would squawk like hell,” Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani says he speaks with Trump, “if not every day, almost every day,” and has made at least three visits to the White House since joining the legal team. He says the president is satisfied with his work as his attorney despite recent controversies stemming from television interviews in which he disclosed contradictory information about payments to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\n“If I’m not up to it, I don’t know who is,” Giuliani said. “I know the Justice Department better than just about anyone.”\n\nGiuliani also said he planned to keep giving media interviews, though he might not do them as frequently.\n\n“Selectively, and when we want to set the agenda,” he said. “And it’s far better that I draw the fire than the president. That’s what a lawyer is for. Some lawyers don’t think so. I think he’s very comfortable now that someone is doing that for him.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/darrensamuelsohn","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T00:22:09.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/a4/72/4f6e097d41078f80e6ebecbe7ad8/180507giuliani-getty-1160.jpg","digest":"J3JhK8hSS69jN43eA1K7iA==\n"}

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg)\n\nRepublican primary voters in West Virginia and Indiana are set to shape the future of Donald Trump’s anti-establishment political revolt on Tuesday, while testing the president’s own ability to steer the passions he helped unleash.\n\nDon Blankenship, a former West Virginia coal baron who was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety regulations, has been surging in several recent polls, despite unified resistance from elected Republican leaders in Washington, including Trump. The president told West Virginia voters to reject Blankenship in a tweet on Monday.\n\n“Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message — no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote,” Blankenship responded, in a clear echo of the president’s rhetoric. “I am Trumpier than Trump, and this morning proves it.”\n\nBlankenship is one of two wealthy self-funding business executives, like Trump, who have emerged with unexpected strength in a primary season that has played out like a televised game show with the singular goal of demonstrating fealty to Trump and fury at the nation’s political elites.\n\n“That dynamic that elected Donald Trump that I thought was going to dissipate after 2016 elections is still there,” said Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin, who is working on other 2018 races.\n\nIn Indiana, the ascendant candidate is Mike Braun, the founder of a warehouse and distribution company who voted in the state’s Democratic primaries until 2012. Just like Blankenship, he is running against two more well-established GOP incumbents, who have spent much of the campaign attacking each other, as they calculated the outsider would face a traditional ceiling of support.\n\nThe outcome of the contests could help shape not just the future of the Republican Party but the odds of Democratic control of the Senate. Both of Tuesday’s contests are in states where Trump won by wide margins and Democratic senators are seeking reelection.\n\nDemocratic incumbents, meanwhile, are facing no serious primary challenges and few potential upsets in swing seats. The closest thing to a left-flank attack will play out Tuesday in Ohio’s gubernatorial primary, where former congressman Dennis Kucinich (D) is running against Richard Cordray, the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Polls suggest a Cordray win.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, remain concerned that a Blankenship victory will spell disaster in November. On Sunday, Trump spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who urged the president to warn that Blankenship would not be able to beat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) in the general election, according to two people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.\n\nBlankenship was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety regulations after an explosion at one of his company’s mines killed 29 people in 2010.\n\nPrivately, Republican leaders have discussed cutting ties with Blankenship should he win the primary, in an effort to protect other GOP candidates from the controversy that surrounds him.\n\n“No way!” Trump tweeted about Blankenship beating Manchin, before referring to the failed 2017 Alabama Senate campaign of Roy Moore. “Remember Alabama.”\n\nBlankenship also referred to Moore’s loss on Monday. After the president’s tweet, Blankenship said that he was probably more conservative than Trump and would not have backed the $1.3 trillion spending bill because it added to budget deficits.\n\n“We all really like President Trump’s policies, but we know that he doesn’t get things right,” Blankenship said in a paid appearance on a local community-access television station. “He recommended that people vote for a guy that was basically accused of pedophilia in Alabama.”\n\nBlankenship is no stranger to such rhetorical combat. He has called McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” in campaign ads, a reference to a drug-smuggling bust on a ship owned by his father-in-law’s family, and attacked the “China family” of his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. He has also used the words “Negro” and “China people,” while also arguing that he was not making racially motivated appeals.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he hopes Blankenship doesn’t prevail, “but if he does, I think you’ll see a lot of Republicans giving a contribution to Joe Manchin. I certainly will.”\n\n“Let’s just hope and pray that doesn’t happen,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.)\n\nMany Republicans cut ties to Alabama Senate candidate Moore after The Washington Post reported on accusations that he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\n\nMcConnell, who prides himself on being unruffled by crises, has been making light of the Blankenship predicament in private. With a few friends, according to two people, he has begun answering his phone with the moniker “Cocaine Mitch.”\n\nThe Indiana Senate contest has similarly hinged on the ability of candidates to channel Trump’s unconventional style. Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), a former Indiana secretary of state, has been campaigning in a military surplus Humvee painted with the stripes of the American flag. Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), a former lobbyist and state GOP executive director, runs a clip of Trump’s inauguration in his campaign ads.\n\nBut the standout has been Braun, who has campaigned as a non-politician, forgoing the traditional sport coat and tie during debates while embracing Trump’s populist rhetoric.\n\n“Politicians put Mexico before Muncie, Beijing before Bloomington,” the narrator says in one of his ads, referencing two Indiana cities. Unlike in West Virginia, Republican leaders have not expressed concerns over Braun facing Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) in November.\n\nIn both states, the Republican candidates have almost no policy disagreements. They all support the Trump agenda, including stricter immigration enforcement, a southern border wall, the recent tax-cut bill, and they vow to fight new gun regulations and limit access to abortion. They all describe themselves as conservatives, and have called for an end to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn some races, Republicans have tried with little success to encourage Democratic cannibalism. A super PAC has taken a similar tack in Ohio’s gubernatorial primary, running a TV ad that warns Democrats that Democratic front-runner Cordray once had an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association.\n\nBy contrast, Republicans have grown increasingly concerned about the primary for the open House seat outside Columbus, which was vacated by a moderate Republican who left for the private sector. It has turned into a proxy war between the House Freedom Caucus, which backs business executive Melanie Leneghan, and the moderate Main Street Partnership, which backs state Sen. Troy Balderson.\n\nBoth candidates are tacking hard to the right. “President Obama nearly destroyed the America we love,” Leneghan says in one ad. “With God’s grace, we elected President Trump, and he needs our help.”\n\nIn his own TV spots, Balderson offers the same agenda. “I’ll end sanctuary cities to stop illegals from taking our jobs, fight alongside Trump to implement his agenda and use conservative grit to build the darn wall,” he says.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won 53 percent of the vote in the district — less than he won in the Pennsylvania district seized by Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) this year. Republicans are nervous about Leneghan making it to the Aug. 7 general election, worried that she will be seen as too extreme for the district.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have had more success interfering with Republican primaries. In West Virginia, a Democratic super PAC called Duty and Country has spent more than $1.8 million attacking Blankenship’s rivals, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins (R), with most of the money directed at Jenkins, according to a person tracking the spending. Another group, Mountain Families PAC, which was founded by a Republican lawyer with ties to McConnell, launched a separate television campaign against Blankenship.\n\nUntil this weekend, Blankenship’s two rivals had focused on criticizing each other, with large television campaigns of negative ads. Blankenship also benefited from his recent debate performances and unconventional campaign ads. Blankenship’s grumbling, deadpan delivery and defiant pose marked a sharp departure from typical Senate candidates.\n\nBlankenship’s wealth has also proved an advantage. In the final week before the primary, Blankenship spent more in television advertising than the Jenkins and Morrisey campaigns combined, according to the person tracking the spending.\n\nDuring a brief press availability on Monday in Charleston, W.Va., a reporter asked Blankenship if he really believed McConnell was connected to the drug trade.\n\n“No,” Blankenship answered, “But I believe that if you’re going to hold me responsible for 7,000 people in 119 coal mines, that hauling cocaine on the high seas when you only have eight or 10 ships is something he should be focused on avoiding. And I think it’s something the public should be aware of.”\n\nJosh Dawsey in Washington and Dan Heyman in Charleston, W.Va., contributed to this report.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T23:38:03.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7YRio4pVr_i45lUUZYeHbARBsrU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4F7KJCSFEI6RJKRLNSIVPRJ54.jpg","digest":"UxrV02EH9UXSPiS2teM3ug==\n"}

He must step down immediately.”\n\nMr. Schneiderman, the chief law enforcement officer of the state, who was widely seen as harboring ambitions to be governor himself one day, is up for re-election this year. No Democrats have declared an intention to challenge him in the primary; Manny Alicandro, a corporate lawyer from New York City, is running as a Republican and officially declared his candidacy on Monday.\n\nIf Mr. Schneiderman does not resign, the Democratic-controlled Assembly could vote to impeach him. A trial would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, which would be joined by judges from the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. A two-thirds vote would be required to remove him.\n\nMr. Schneiderman had been previously outspoken about women’s issues, announcing, for instance, a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here,” Mr. Schneiderman said then.\n\nSince 2017, Mr. Schneiderman had also raised his profile nationally by taking on President Trump’s agenda repeatedly in the courts. He is pushing to change state law so that his office could prosecute Mr. Trump’s aides even if the president pardoned them.\n\nMs. Manning Barish, in The New Yorker account, described being slapped by Mr. Schneiderman after they had both been drinking; she and Ms. Selvaratnam said several of the attacks occurred after alcohol had been consumed.\n\n“It was horrendous,” she said. “It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fiber, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”\n\nDebra S. Katz, a lawyer for Ms. Manning Barish, said that it was Mr. Schneiderman’s “fantasy and his fantasy alone that the behavior was welcome.”\n\nMr. Schneiderman, she continued, “has made a career railing against this type of abuse. Yet apparently he intends to revictimize these courageous women who have come forward by pulling out that age old sexist trope that they wanted it.”\n\nBoth Ms. Manning Barish and Ms. Selvaratnam have in recent days repeatedly declined to comment when reporters for The Times asked them to address the allegations.\n\n“After I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who’s next, and knew something needed to be done,” Ms. Selvaratnam said in a statement released Monday night. “So I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.”\n\nMs. Manning Barish also followed the article’s publication with a post on Twitter, saying that she “could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me.”\n\nA former wife of Mr. Schneiderman’s was taken aback by the allegations being leveled against him.\n\n“I’ve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend,” said Jennifer Cunningham, his ex-wife and frequent political strategist. “These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father.”\n\nMr. Schneiderman has long been regarded as one of the state’s most progressive politicians, even before his 2013 lawsuit against Trump University and his subsequent suits against the Trump administration made him the darling of the political left. Last fall, Mr. Schneiderman’s office proudly pointed to a segment on the late-night comedy show “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” in which the attorney general was described as “a hero who stood up to democracy’s nemesis,” a Superman-like character known as Schneider-man.\n\nHis credentials as an advocate for women, in particular, had gone unquestioned.\n\nIn 2010, as a state senator from Manhattan, he introduced a bill to make intentional strangulation to the point of unconsciousness a violent felony. That same year, the National Organization for Women’s New York branch endorsed him in his successful bid for attorney general, citing his “unmatched work” in “protecting women who are victims of domestic abuse.”\n\nFor several years, his office has published a “Know Your Rights” brochure for victims of domestic violence. “We must recognize that our work keeping New Yorkers safe from domestic violence is far from over,” Mr. Schneiderman said in the announcement for the 2016 brochure.\n\nAt the direction of Governor Cuomo, he is currently reviewing the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her.\n\nSome national Republicans were gleeful at the allegations. The Republican research shop America Rising quickly packaged Mr. Schneiderman’s ties to other prominent national Democrats.\n\nAnd on Monday evening, Mr. Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., dug up an old tweet from Mr. Schneiderman in which he said “No one is above the law” and tweeted at him, “You were saying???”","author":"http://www.nytimes.com/by/danny-hakim, https://www.nytimes.com/by/vivian-wang","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T23:36:45.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/nyregion/08Schneiderman/merlin_136338426_149798ac-7134-41e0-bd9b-7be2bb86002e-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"y4CPqE8OCJw4u9zcmU6hNQ==\n"}

Knowing she would get criticized if she pursued anything related to social media, Mr. Trump suggested she take an easier path. But Mrs. Trump ultimately decided to make good online behavior a part of something broader, an East Wing official said.\n\nMr. Trump appeared pleased. “That was truly a beautiful and heartfelt speech,” he said in remarks in the Rose Garden after Mrs. Trump spoke. “It’s the way she feels, very strongly. America is truly blessed to have a first lady who is so devoted to our country.”\n\nIn her brief time at the White House — Mrs. Trump moved to Washington with her son, Barron, last June — she took her time establishing her own profile, with only a stilletoed misstep or two, literally: She piqued the public’s interest by wearing high heels on a trip to Texas after it was hit by Hurricane Harvey. She also drew positive attention for speaking against the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., that left one woman dead.\n\nIn January, after news broke that Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, was paid $130,000 before the 2016 election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, Mrs. Trump cut back her public appearances. Her office dismissed her absence as a coincidence, while others close to the president said that Mrs. Trump had been angered by the news reports.\n\nIn recent months, Mrs. Trump has emerged more often without Mr. Trump by her side, although she has twice been seen avoiding or swatting the president’s hand away during public appearances. She is rolling out her platform even as Mr. Trump and his legal team have added new, confusing contours to the story surrounding Ms. Clifford.\n\nIf Mrs. Trump remains something of an enigma to most Americans, there is at least some evidence that the public has warmed to the wife of a president whose popularity remains at historic lows. In a CNN poll conducted May 2 to May 5, 57 percent of respondents said they held a favorable view of Mrs. Trump — up 10 percentage points from January — while 27 percent had a negative view.","author":"http://www.nytimes.com/by/katie-rogers","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T23:31:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/us/08dc-melania-sub/08dc-melania-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","digest":"fPnnv2q7UJuikp3QNGaczg==\n"}

Mueller III on Monday morning, again railing against the lawyers working for Mueller.\n\n“The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice,” he wrote on Twitter, “and just wait ’till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!”\n\nThose conflicts of interest are probably the ones Trump has pointed to in the past: past contributions to Democratic candidates for Congress and the presidency. Why this would not be known to federal judges, given that the data is publicly available, isn’t clear. In fact, we tallied that information Monday afternoon to get a sense of scale.\n\nSince the 2000 cycle, members of Mueller’s team have given over $77,000 to Democratic candidates, including the elections of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nWe’ve noted in the past that this fact needs to be tempered with recognition both that campaign contributions do not mean that federal investigators have abandoned their professional duty to be impartial and that the people leading the investigation, including Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, are Republicans.\n\nBut still: $77,000 to Democrats.\n\nAnd it gets worse. Post analysis of Federal Election Commission data reveals that the Mueller team’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss has given far more to Democrats all by himself than all of Mueller’s team combined. He, too, gave to Clinton’s past campaigns, as well as those of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nSince 2000, he’s given more than $330,000 to Democrats and Democratic committees.\n\nThis mystery person is, of course, Trump himself. That he’d given so much more to Democrats was noted on Twitter by journalist Marcy Wheeler; we decided to put numbers to it.\n\nTrump’s contributions to Democrats dropped off sharply after Obama won election, a shift that mirrored Trump’s embrace of hard-right political rhetoric. After the 2008 cycle, Mueller’s team gave $44,500 to Democrats; Trump gave only $2,000.\n\nIn the four most recent cycles, Trump gave more than $300,000 to Republicans. Mueller’s team gave only $2,500.\n\nIt’s not unusual that trial attorneys give more to Democrats than Republicans. Seven in 10 trial attorneys and district attorneys who made contributions in the 2012 and 2014 cycles gave to Democrats, according to FEC filings. Just as it’s not surprising that a businessman would give to politicians of both parties or, if he’s based in New York City, mostly to Democrats.\n\nOf the 18 attorneys we identified on Mueller’s team, half gave no money to anyone, according to our analysis. Another five gave $1,000 or less. The one who gave the most also gave to two Republicans.\n\nWhich are the “13 Angry Democrats” isn’t clear.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T22:09:35.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/who2J37U-mwXpXFzM1BgUzKlPtE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AE7U5PTUHE4PDBP5OQNAVZPVDQ.jpg","digest":"+wu28CTDhPSJrSRGerPUBw==\n"}

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in Washington on Monday, said that as far as he knows, the administration has no clear “Plan B” for what to do next.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that he would announce his decision at 2 p.m. Tuesday. He is free to reimpose all U.S. sanctions, and even announce new ones. But he is expected to stop short of reneging on the deal altogether. ­Instead, he will address a portion of the wide range of sanctions that were waived when the deal was first implemented, while leaving in limbo other waivers that are due in July.\n\nThe affected sanctions, imposed by Congress in 2012, require other countries to reduce Iranian oil imports or risk U.S. sanctions on their banks and their ability to conduct Iran-related financial transactions. Waivers on those sanctions must be signed every 120 days, and the next deadline is Saturday.\n\n[Iran’s foreign minister warns that nation will restart ‘nuclear activities’ if U.S. withdraws from accord]\n\nTrump is unlikely to specify how the United States will treat the complex set of legal designations on banks, companies and people affected by the import waiver, officials said. The Treasury Department has been drawing contingency plans, and it could take months for the measures to be fully reimposed.\n\nBut “you could immediately see countries start to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil,” said Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who headed the sanctions team during negotiations on the agreement. Countries, and the companies that actually buy and sell oil, could say, “Let’s not bank on this all turning out okay,” he said.\n\nThe Iranian economy has been in crisis mode for much of this year, with the currency, the rial, losing more than a third of its value, despite an increase in oil production and sales. Iran has long alleged that the United States has violated the deal by continuing to make it difficult for U.S. and international companies to invest there, despite the removal of sanctions.\n\nUnder the terms of the nuclear deal — negotiated under President Barack Obama, along with the three European allies, Russia and China — Tehran agreed to sharply curtail the quantity and the quality of enriched uranium it produced for the next 15 years. It shut down most of its nuclear production facilities and shipped most of its stored fuel out of the country. In return, nuclear-related international economic sanctions were lifted, and the United States agreed to activate waiver provisions for its unilateral sanctions.\n\nOfficials, who spoke about the upcoming announcement on the condition of anonymity, suggested that Trump will use the threat of further measures as leverage on both the Europeans and Iran itself.\n\nTrump, who criticized the Iran deal throughout his presidential campaign, said in January that the United States would “withdraw” unless the agreement was rewritten to address his concerns. They included its sunset and verification provisions; Iran’s separate ballistic missile development and testing programs; and Iranian support for terrorism and interference in regional conflicts, such as in Syria and Yemen.\n\nU.S. regional allies, led by Israel and Saudi Arabia, strongly supported his position. They said Iran threatened their own national security.\n\nBritain, France and Germany, while saying they shared Trump’s concerns, noted that Iran had not violated the nuclear accord and said the world was better off keeping the deal in place while other worries were separately addressed. Over the past several months, the three have agreed to take new measures, including sanctions, to crack down on Iran’s regional activities and its missile program.\n\nBut despite their promises and appeals — and statements of support by Trump’s own military advisers and a number of U.S. lawmakers who previously had objected to the deal — the Europeans were unable to persuade the president. His tough stand has been bolstered by new members of his national security team, including national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both long-standing opponents of the agreement.\n\nIn his announcement, Trump is expected to describe the action as one element of a tougher position on Iran, although it remained unclear whether he will propose any additional policy elements to deal with Iran’s regional activities and ballistic missiles.\n\nHe will cite Iranian documents about a 1990s-era covert nuclear weapons project as proof that Iran lied about the extent of its program, two people familiar with discussions about the decision said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled the documents last week.\n\nThe Israeli presentation was widely criticized as a publicity stunt designed to influence U.S. public opinion with information that was widely known and had provided the impetus for the negotiations in the first place. The U.S. intelligence community has said the weapons program ended in 2003.\n\nIn a tweet Monday, Trump alleged that John F. Kerry, who led Obama’s negotiating team while serving as secretary of state, was engaging in “possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy,” referring to a Boston Globe report that Kerry was consulting with the European allies.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a global risk-analysis firm, said a withdrawal from the Iran deal would be the “biggest slap in the face to date to U.S. allies,” more significant than withdrawing from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations and the Paris climate accord, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Japan and other nations.\n\nTrump’s decision comes weeks before he is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a bid to curb that nation’s nuclear weapons program. Some foreign policy experts said that canceling the Iran deal could send a message to Kim’s regime that the United States is an unreliable negotiating partner.\n\nBut Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said at a conference Monday that the Trump White House would use a withdrawal to “send the signal that an Iran deal is not good enough for North Korea — that they need to do better than an Iran deal.”\n\n“In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other,” Cha said. “I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive, because they think they’re different from everybody else, anyway.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/nakamuradavid","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T21:05:20.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TRRoGsjFp9_8cllwKTeIpR2dikA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DAWEQASSGAI6RJKRLNSIVPRJ54.jpg","digest":"xn3DbxzQEylemqzTs0z9Ig==\n"}

Did They Also Try to Block His Medal of Honor?","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/navy-seals-allegedly-left-behind-120002859.html","text":"As the pre-dawn twilight crept over an Afghan mountainside, an Air Force commando named Jay huddled in the snow, listening to a distressed voice crackle over his radio, then fade away. Moments later, he says, the voice came again, breaking through the static in little more than an anguished whisper: “This is Mako Three Zero Charlie.... This is Mako Three Zero Charlie….” The same six words, over and over, each time dissipating before Jay could hear anything else.\n\nJay was part of an elite reconnaissance team operating behind enemy lines, and he immediately recognized the call sign and voice. They belonged to his counterpart on another team: Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman. From his hidden perch, Jay responded again and again on his powerful satellite-capable radio. But he received no reply. The voice continued for about 40 minutes, he says, like a plaintive mantra—“This is Mako Three Zero Charlie…. This is Mako Three Zero Charlie….” Then it fell silent. It wasn’t until the next evening that Jay learned Chapman had died, that he was the last American to hear him alive.\n\nToday, some 16 years after Chapman’s tragic death, fierce disagreement over what happened on that snowy peak threatens to overshadow two Medal of Honor recommendations that—as of publication—await White House approval. The bitter dispute pits members of the Navy SEALs against Air Force special operators and Army Rangers. It has entangled numerous senior military leaders, several of whom had personal links to the desperate fight on Takur Ghar mountain.\n\nTrending: Who Is Oliver North? New NRA President Was Behind Illegal Iran-Contra Arms Sales\n\nThe controversy revolves around Operation Anaconda, a March 2002 attempt to surround and destroy a large Al-Qaeda force. It took place in eastern Afghanistan and cost the lives of eight Americans, seven of them on Takur Ghar. Chapman was among the dead. Using Predator drone footage and other evidence, the Air Force has argued that a SEAL Team 6 unit mistakenly left him for dead while retreating under heavy fire. Afterward, the Air Force claims, Chapman fought on for an hour, badly wounded and alone, before Al-Qaeda militants killed him as he provided cover for an approaching helicopter.\n\nThe SEALs, however, reject the claim that Chapman was alive when they fled. “The SEALs did not want to be told—officially—that they left a comrade on that mountain alive,” says a former defense official, who, like most sources mentioned in this story, requested anonymity for security reasons or to describe sensitive high-level discussions about members of classified units.\n\nNever-released witness statements and video footage seen by a Newsweek reporter appear to support the Air Force’s version of events. Defense Secretary James Mattis eventually agreed, sending the recommendation to award Chapman a Medal of Honor to the White House in the fall of 2017. Should President Donald Trump sign off on it, Chapman’s Medal of Honor would be the first based primarily on technical intelligence rather than eyewitness accounts. (The Air Force and the Navy both declined to make any official comment for this story.)\n\nWhat has shocked and angered some sources familiar with the battle is that Mattis has also recommended the same award for then–Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski, the SEAL team leader who allegedly left Chapman behind. Some special operators blame Slabinski for not only Chapman’s death but also the lost lives of six other special ops on the mountain. Others say it’s absurd to recommend someone for the Medal of Honor for his bravery in a fight in which he left a teammate behind, albeit by mistake. Informed by a Newsweek reporter that Slabinski was in line for a Medal of Honor, an Army special operator who took part in the operation was aghast. “You kicked me in the nuts when you told me that,” he says. Mike, a former Air Force targeting analyst who monitored the Predator feed of the Takur Ghar fight in real time and re-watched it twice last year at the Air Force’s request, was similarly taken aback. “I’m completely shocked that the Navy is putting a package up.”\n\nSome observers are angry at the Navy for even recommending Slabinski for the award, which they claim was part of a campaign to sabotage the Air Force’s effort on behalf of Chapman. Such a campaign would be unprecedented, according to military awards expert Doug Sterner. “I cannot think of a single instance in which one branch of service opposed a Medal of Honor for another one,” he says.\n\nChapman’s supporters say the entire episode shows the extraordinary length that the SEALs will go to protect their reputation. A SEAL who took part in the Takur Ghar fight strongly disputed that assessment: “That’s a bunch of BS.” The blame, he says, lies with the Air Force for allowing the controversy to become public without doing “due diligence,” which would have included interviewing him and his fellow SEALs. “The Air Force caused all the problem,” he adds, “by just trying to jam something down everybody’s throat without even talking to us.”\n\nOthers familiar with the battle sprang to Slabinski’s defense, even as they acknowledged the unusual optics of awarding him a Medal of Honor. “He’s an introvert, but he’s very bold in his actions,” says a former senior SEAL Team 6 officer who served frequently with Slabinski. “I thought he was a great leader.”\n\nA former defense official familiar with the discussions over the Medal of Honor recommendations is adamant that Slabinski, a second-generation SEAL who retired from the Navy as a master chief petty officer in 2014, deserves his award, just as Chapman does. But he bemoans how, as the two award packages wended their way through the approvals process, the heroism of two brave men has at times taken second place to what he termed “the tribal aspects” of the special ops community.\n\n“It is a bureaucratic story,” he says, “that is not covered in glory.”\n\nThat story began less than six months after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when the United States launched Operation Anaconda, a high-profile battle against Al-Qaeda. From the beginning, it went awry. The Americans had expected the jihadi fighters to be massed in the villages on the floor of the Shahikot Valley, but they weren’t. Instead, when the U.S. infantry landed in the valley by helicopter on March 2, they realized the enemy had dug in on the high ground overlooking it. For two days, the militants used automatic weapons and mortar fire to pin down the Americans and forced their Afghan allies to retreat before even reaching the valley.\n\nThere was, however, one successful part of the operation. In the days before the battle, two reconnaissance teams from the Army’s Delta Force and one from SEAL Team 6 sneaked behind enemy lines from their base in Gardez, 8 miles north of the Shahikot. From their vantage points high above the valley, they called in devastating air strikes and provided critical intelligence on the Al-Qaeda forces. Their success caught the attention of SEAL Team 6’s forward headquarters at Bagram Air Base, about 90 miles north of Gardez. The reconnaissance effort and Team 6 were each part of a task force composed of units from Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC (pronounced “jay-sock”), the secretive organization that runs many of the military’s most sensitive missions. Team 6 had seen very little action in Afghanistan and was eager to get into the fight. Early on March 3, a day after the main assault, the task force commander gave the order to send more SEALs into the valley. One of those teams, led by Slabinski, was called Mako 30.\n\nSlabinski’s mission was to establish an observation post on top of Takur Ghar, a 10,469-foot mountain in the southeast corner of the Shahikot. The plan was to insert Mako 30’s eight operators by helicopter near the mountain and have them patrol up to the peak under the cover of darkness. This would allow the SEALs, wearing night vision goggles, to spot any enemy fighters, shoot them, call in airstrikes or get away. But a series of unforeseeable delays meant the team ran out of time to land at the starting location and maneuver up the mountain before dawn.\n\nMeanwhile, the chain of command began to fray. Rather than communicating through the reconnaissance operations center where they were at Gardez, the SEALs began talking on the radio straight back to their headquarters in Bagram. Slabinski told Bagram he wanted to postpone the mission 24 hours. But, for reasons that have never been made clear, his bosses pressured him to get to the top of the mountain that night. Feeling he had little choice, Slabinski asked the Army special operations helicopter crew to fly his team straight to the peak. This would break a cardinal rule of reconnaissance: Never infiltrate by helicopter directly to your observation post, as it gives away your position to the enemy. But an Air Force gunship had flown over the frozen peak earlier that night and said it was clear of enemy fighters.\n\nThe helicopter crew agreed to do what Slabinski had asked. When Mako 30’s Chinook helicopter, known as Razor 03, arrived over the mountaintop, however, militants encamped there fired on the aircraft, badly damaging it. As the pilot struggled to abort the landing and wrestle his helicopter away from danger, Petty Officer First Class Neil Roberts from Mako 30 fell out the back and into the deep snow. With the aircraft too badly damaged to return to the peak, the pilot crash-landed at the north end of the valley. Another helicopter picked up the crew and the seven other operators and whisked them off to Gardez.\n\nAware that the militants were unlikely to spare Roberts if they captured him, six members of Mako 30 quickly boarded another special ops aircraft that flew them back to the mountain. They didn’t know it at the time, but they were already too late. Analysis of Predator footage later revealed that the Al-Qaeda fighters killed Roberts just before 4:30 a.m. on March 4. All they knew was that their mission was incredibly dangerous. “When I made the decision to rescue Neil, I just knew at the time that that was going to be the last thing that I did on this earth,” Slabinski told a Navy SEAL Foundation audience in New York on March 2, 2017. “I was convinced of it.”\n\nThe helicopter touched down on the peak shortly before 5 a.m. Slabinski jumped off first but stumbled. Next was Chapman, the team’s only non-SEAL. He belonged to the Air Force’s 24th Special Tactics Squadron (STS). Known by its members as “the Two-Four,” the unit is the Air Force equivalent of Delta Force or SEAL Team 6, and it works exclusively for JSOC. As Mako 30’s combat controller, Chapman’s primary role was to call in airstrikes.\n\nThe Mako 30 operators again faced withering fire when they alighted from the helicopter. As the aircraft departed, the men split into three pairs. Chapman and Slabinski headed uphill, slogging through the knee-deep snow to reach a bunker from which they were taking fire. They killed the two men in the bunker, but then machine gun fire erupted from a second bunker nearby. Suddenly, Chapman went down. Slabinski glanced over at him. The airman’s rifle was laying across his chest, the aiming laser rising and falling in time with his breathing, so the SEAL knew he was alive. Moments later, a second member of the team was wounded as enemy fire poured from seemingly every direction. The SEALs were overmatched, and they didn’t see Roberts anywhere. Slabinski had just seconds to get his men out of the crossfire. He looked back toward Chapman. The laser was no longer moving. The airman, he concluded, was dead. Slabinski ordered his men to retreat, so the SEALs ran and slid down the side of the mountain, pursued by machine gun fire.\n\nThe SEALs found temporary shelter under a rocky overhang. From there, they called in their location to an Air Force gunship. Then, the five survivors, two seriously wounded, moved about 5,000 feet in six hours to a position where a helicopter eventually rescued them.\n\nBut as the SEALs made their escape, satellite radio failures and confusion between various headquarters meant that a JSOC quick reaction force—an Army Ranger platoon—launched from Bagram in two Chinooks and headed for Takur Ghar. While one aircraft awaited further instruction, the other flew straight to the peak, unaware that two helicopters had already been shot up trying to land there. This time, the militants downed the Chinook, known as Razor 01, with a rocket-propelled grenade as it landed. In the ensuing day-long battle, three Rangers, a special ops aviator and an Air Force pararescueman were killed before the Rangers finally gained control of the mountaintop.\n\nAfter the fight on Takur Ghar, Army and Air Force special operators blamed their losses on poor decision-making by the SEALs. Some members of Chapman’s unit, the 24th STS, were so upset that they tried to avoid assignments with SEAL Team 6, says a former Delta Force operator.\n\nAnd it didn’t take long for word to leak that perhaps Chapman hadn’t died when the SEALs said he did. “Guys knew something was wrong the next day, because of the way Navy guys were talking about it,” says a former combat controller familiar with the fight and its aftermath. Within weeks, Chapman’s colleagues in the 24th STS concluded that he had still been alive when the SEALs retreated and had fought on alone against impossible odds, he adds.\n\nThat possibility was first officially raised by Army Lieutenant Colonel Andy Milani, a special operations aviation officer, whom JSOC appointed to investigate the battle. Milani’s probe remains classified, but he repeated his findings in an unclassified paper he wrote while attending the Army War College in 2003. In that paper, he noted that Predator footage had captured a fight on Takur Ghar’s peak during the period between the SEALs’ retreat and the downing of Razor 01. Milani’s investigation showed that Roberts was dead by the time Mako 30 returned to the mountain, but someone was still fighting on the top of Takur Ghar at a time when no Americans were supposedly alive there. According to Milani, the footage showed a man in a bunker, engaging at least two other fighters in close combat. The lieutenant colonel laid out two possible explanations: Either Al-Qaeda fighters mistook each other for Americans, or the mysterious figure was Chapman, fighting for his life after the SEALs left him behind.\n\nMilani did not reach a conclusion, but in January 2003 the Air Force awarded Chapman a posthumous Air Force Cross for his actions up to the point when Slabinski had said he was killed. (Like the Navy Cross and the Army’s Distinguished Service Cross, the Air Force Cross is a valor award second only to the Medal of Honor.) In making the case for this award, the Air Force relied heavily on witness statements from three of the surviving members of Mako 30, who all described him in heroic terms. Slabinski, in particular, credited Chapman with saving their lives. “I know if John hadn’t engaged the first enemy position, it would have surely killed us all before we reached cover,” Slabinski said in his statement, which Newsweek obtained. “John Died [sic] saving us from the enemy fire which was effective from three sides when he was killed.... John deserves the highest medal we can get for him.”\n\nThe Navy likewise awarded Slabinski a Navy Cross for his actions from the moment Razor 03 crash-landed to his team’s eventual rescue after the loss of Roberts and Chapman. “During this entire sustained engagement, Senior Chief Petty Officer Slabinski exhibited classic grace under fire in steadfastly leading the intrepid rescue operation, saving the lives of his wounded men and setting the conditions for the ultimate vanquishing of the enemy and the seizing of Takur Ghar,” reads the citation.\n\nWith the casualties buried and the service crosses awarded, Takur Ghar faded from the headlines for more than a decade. But within the tight-knit world of Air Force special operators, a desire still burned for the White House to recognize what they viewed as the full extent of Chapman’s heroism. Thirteen years after his death, they would get their chance.\n\nDon't miss: Self-Driving Uber Crash: Likely Cause of Fatal Car Accident Detailed in Report\n\nSince the Vietnam War, no Air Force personnel have received the Medal of Honor. And in May 2015, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James read an article that wondered what it would take for an airman to be awarded the medal in the post-9/11 era. The topic intrigued James, who was in charge of recommending Medals of Honor to the secretary of defense, who in turn had to decide whether to endorse the recommendations and submit them to the White House for approval. Because almost all of the seven Air Force Crosses and about half of the Silver Stars awarded to airmen since September 11, 2001, had gone to special operators, James ordered Air Force Special Operations Command to investigate whether any awards deserved to be upgraded. Complicating James’s directive: Pentagon regulations stipulated that for a lesser award to become a Medal of Honor, new information had to be presented.\n\nAfter at least six months, according to James, her team reported back that it had identified a possible upgrade for Chapman’s Air Force Cross. The new information consisted largely of a careful analysis of the video shot by the Predator of the action on Takur Ghar. Individuals appeared as little more than black blobs on the infrared footage the drone was transmitting as it circled more than a mile above the mountain. By comparing and combining the Predator footage with video shot by a circling Air Force gunship, analysts were able to isolate the blob that was Chapman and track his movements.\n\nThe Air Force then created a picture-within-a-picture video presentation, in which an animated recreation of the fight fills most of the screen, synced to the drone footage playing in a box. The video has never been made public, and Air Force Special Operations Command declined to comment for this story. But a Newsweek reporter was able to view the video and take notes. As an Air Force officer narrates, the video shows Slabinski jumping from the back ramp of the Chinook, losing his balance and falling into the snow. Next off the helicopter is Chapman, who fires as he charges toward the first bunker, which is about 100 feet away. Slabinski follows, at one point almost catching up with him. Then Chapman surges ahead and arrives at the bunker, shooting into it for several seconds before Slabinski reaches him, about 90 seconds after getting off the helicopter.\n\n“When Sergeant Chapman reached the bunker complex, he killed two fighters and took control of the terrain,” says the narrator in his voiceover. “By destroying the enemy’s frontline position, Sergeant Chapman eliminated the closest threat to the Mako 30 team.” The video thus validates Slabinski’s statement, in which he credits Chapman with killing two enemy fighters then occupying the bunker. The only difference: Chapman probably fired the shots that killed the two Al-Qaeda fighters in the bunker from almost point-blank range, rather than the “twenty five yards” Slabinski estimated in his statement.\n\nChapman then opens fire on the second Al-Qaeda bunker, about 30 feet away. “Without hesitation or regard for his own safety, Sergeant Chapman moved from a position of cover to engage the nearby machine gun,” the narrator says. “While Sergeant Chapman was firing at Bunker 2, an enemy fighter flanked him, which resulted in very close combat. Sergeant Chapman killed the enemy fighter, but during this engagement, Sergeant Chapman was shot and went down.” Although it’s not possible to identify the exact moment he was shot on the video, it must have been within two minutes of getting off the helicopter. It is at this point that Slabinski has said he glanced at Chapman and assessed he was still alive.\n\nOf the other four SEALs on the mission, two followed Slabinski and Chapman. The other two headed in the opposite direction. The footage shows one of the SEALs who had joined Slabinski on top of a boulder shooting an M60 machine gun before getting shot and falling down, and the three SEALs huddling at the base of the boulder for a few seconds. Less than three minutes after arriving, the SEALs begin their retreat. Slabinski has said that it was then that he concluded that Chapman was dead.\n\nSlabinski declined to be interviewed for this article, directing a reporter to the Naval Special Warfare Command public affairs office, which did not respond to requests for comment. But in 2016, he told The New York Times that after giving the order to withdraw, he actually crawled over Chapman’s body in the rush to get off the mountain and saw no sign of life. “I’m already 95 percent in my mind that he’s been killed,” Slabinski said. “That’s why I was like, ‘OK, we’ve got to move.’”\n\nHowever, the Predator video, which offers an uninterrupted view of Slabinski during this period, does not appear to show him crawling anywhere near Chapman. But it does show him and two other SEALs moving past the body of Neil Roberts as they begin their retreat. “They go right over him,” says the former combat controller, who is familiar with the footage. Because the SEALs never mentioned finding Roberts, some have speculated that Slabinski became disoriented and confused Roberts’s body with Chapman’s, which was only a few yards away. “It’s actually a common theory that the body that Slab believes he checked was Roberts,” says the former combat controller. “That happens to be my theory.”\n\nThe SEALs are on the peak of the mountain for less than four minutes. As they make their escape, Chapman’s body lies motionless in the first bunker for about 12 minutes. But then the footage captures movement there, even though no one has approached it since the SEALs had fled. The man in the bunker proceeds to move around and fire his weapon for about an hour. “I’m 110 percent certain that’s Chapman,” says Mike, the Air Force targeting analyst for the original mission. In a 2017 analysis of the video conducted for the Air Force and obtained by Newsweek, Mike counted 39 distinct muzzle flashes emanating from the first bunker between approximately 5:40 a.m. and 6:08 a.m. “It’s evident—you can see Chapman is definitely pulling the trigger on that M4, and rounds are coming,” he says. “I don’t know how many [militants] he took out, but it was a hell of a battle.”\n\nMike’s analysis notes the man in the bunker is firing in almost every direction. Chapman, he says, was desperately defending himself from enemies that had him surrounded. Twice, Al-Qaeda fighters managed to creep up on the bunker, and Chapman is seen killing them in close quarters combat. The nature of the fight and the daylight that was spreading over the mountain make it highly unlikely, the former combat controller says, that this was a case of two enemy fighters attacking each other by mistake. “They’re on top of each other,” he adds. “There’s no confusion here.”\n\nShortly after Chapman kills the second Al-Qaeda fighter, the Air Force claims, and moments before the helicopter carrying the Rangers arrives over the peak, he emerges from his covered position and shoots at the militants in the second bunker. This action led to his death, and is central to the Air Force’s case that he deserves the Medal of Honor. Chapman took this enormous risk to provide covering fire for the helicopter that was headed for the peak, the Air Force contends. “Sergeant Chapman understood the ramifications of his actions,” says the Air Force narrator. “He selflessly moved in front of the enemy machine gun in Bunker 2 in order to engage the threat to the inbound helicopter.”\n\nThat decision is worthy of a Medal of Honor on its own, according to the former combat controller. “He climbs out of the bunker having been shot a half a dozen times [and attacked in] hand-to-hand combat, and then the final two rounds that took his life are the only thing that stopped him,” he says. “Shot in the foot, the leg, the torso. I mean, this guy, we don’t know what he thought, but he made the decision in as much pain and fear as he must have had, to climb out of the bunker when the helicopter was coming…. It’s an amazing, courageous thing to do.”\n\nThe Rangers eventually found his body in the first bunker. An autopsy later revealed that Chapman was killed by two bullets that hit him in the upper body. “One exploded his aorta,” says the former combat controller, who is familiar with the autopsy, “and then your blood pressure drops to zero, and you expire, and that takes 30 seconds, maybe.”\n\nThe video presentation wasn’t the only evidence the Air Force used to buttress its case for Chapman. It also obtained a sworn statement from someone never previously interviewed in connection with Takur Ghar: Jay, Chapman’s counterpart on one of the Delta Force teams, which occupied an observation post roughly 3 miles north of Takur Ghar. Jay was from Chapman’s unit and knew his radio style. In September 2016, in an affidavit obtained by Newsweek, he told an Air Force lawyer that he repeatedly heard Chapman’s voice and call sign—Mako Three Zero Charlie—on the radio during the period when the video shows him fighting for his life. “The voice on the radio was John Chapman,” Jay said, in comments never previously made public.\n\nA Mako 30 SEAL claims the Navy investigated Jay’s assertions and concluded they were inaccurate. “That was all disproved by comms logs and who was where,” tells Newsweek. “When it was dug into, it was not factual.” He adds: “We were on all the same freqs [radio frequencies], and we never heard that.”\n\nThe former combat controller disputes this assertion. “They weren’t on the same freqs,” he says. “That’s a smokescreen. He’s toeing the party line.” The SEALs would have been on an inter-team frequency on their handheld radios, whereas “Jay would have been on battlefield common [frequency],” the former combat controller says, adding that there were no logs in which Chapman’s calls would have been recorded, because the frequency he was calling on would not have reached any of the command posts where those logs were kept.\n\nIn addition to the video and Jay’s witness statement, Chapman’s autopsy, which the Air Force re-analyzed as part of its investigation, also supported the case that he had fought for a sustained period on the peak. “The man was shot and fragged 16 times, to include…contusions on his face, nose, neck and hands,” says the former combat controller. Chapman’s autopsy states that all the airman’s wounds occurred before his death, he says. “That didn’t happen in the first two minutes.” The bruises to Chapman’s hands, neck and face, he adds, were likely the result of hand-to-hand combat with the two militants who made it as far as the bunker before he killed them.\n\nA final piece of evidence supporting the Air Force’s case: According to two sources familiar with the details of Chapman’s award package, when he and his gear were recovered, he was found to have fired all his usable ammunition before succumbing to his wounds, Chapman had emptied six 30-round magazines—far more than he would have during the two minutes or less that elapsed before Slabinski saw him fall.\n\nIn January 2016, Defense Secretary Ash Carter directed the military to conduct a review of service crosses and Silver Stars from the post-9/11 conflicts, to see if any warranted an upgrade. The Air Force’s attempt to boost Chapman’s award became part of the review. In his directive, Carter waived the requirement that “new, substantive, and relevant material information be provided to justify an upgrade,” says Army Major Dave Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman. However, Air Force officials and others close to the Chapman upgrade effort were seemingly unaware that he did so.\n\nThe Air Force divided its conclusions about Chapman’s exploits into his actions from the moment Mako 30 landed back on Takur Ghar to when the SEALs retreated, and the events on the peak after the SEALs had withdrawn. For Air Force Secretary James, it was the latter, and particularly the video evidence, that convinced her that Chapman deserved the Medal of Honor.\n\n“That was all I needed,” she tells Newsweek. “That was like forensic proof in a crime scene, almost.” She forwarded her recommendation to Carter’s office, confident that the Air Force’s case was ironclad. “I thought it was going to be a slam-dunk, easy-to-get through-package,” James says.\n\nOn August 27, 2016, The New York Times published a story (co-authored by this reporter) about the Air Force’s effort to get Chapman a Medal of Honor. The article said that the Air Force’s “findings could rekindle old tensions” in the special operations community over the mission. And to James’s surprise—and alarm—it did. “People were afraid of getting blamed for the fact that the mission didn’t go well, and then on top of that it’s a godawful thing to believe now that you left someone behind for dead who in fact was alive,” she says. “There’s a lot of guilt going on here, and there’s also the reputation of the SEALs at stake.”\n\nWithin a few days of the story’s publication, a gathering of senior military leaders gave James the chance to speak with Army General Tony Thomas, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, she says. He had been the 1st Ranger Battalion commander in Afghanistan at the time of the battle. The three Rangers who died were his men, something no one had told her.\n\nJames says she asked Thomas if she could count on his support regarding her recommendation to upgrade Chapman’s award. He assured her his headquarters was “absolutely behind” the recommendation, she says. (A military official who has discussed this issue with Thomas says that according to the general, no such conversation took place.) James says she walked away from the conversation with renewed confidence that the upgrade would proceed smoothly. Events soon changed her mind.\n\nMost popular: ‘Rick and Morty’ Season 3 Blu-ray Review: From Pickle Rick to Evil Morty, Peak TV\n\nFrom the beginning of its effort to get Chapman’s award upgraded, the Air Force appears to have taken extraordinary care not to impugn Slabinski or the SEALs. Air Force officials knew they had much to lose from picking a fight with such a politically influential group, so they tip-toed around the notion that members of the SEALs’ most elite outfit had inadvertently abandoned a teammate in the middle of a firefight. “Nobody was accusing Slabinski or any of the other members of the team of having done anything other than their very best under these terrible circumstances,” James says.\n\nIn his voice-over for the Air Force’s video presentation, the narrator describes Slabinski’s decision to retreat from the mountaintop in positive terms: “This bold action likely averted a catastrophic loss of the entire team. The team leader’s intent was to suppress the enemy with airpower. The team hoped to eliminate the threat, locate Petty Officer Roberts, recover Sergeant Chapman’s body and fulfill their commitment to leave no man behind. Once again, the enemy and the environment thwarted the team’s plan.”\n\nNonetheless, by late 2016, it was becoming clear that the SEALs were going to resist the Air Force’s attempt to upgrade Chapman’s award based on his actions after the SEALs retreated from the mountaintop. “They didn’t want to be seen as having left Tech Sergeant Chapman behind,” says a former Air Force official, adding that this applied to both the members of Mako 30 as well as the SEAL leaders. “It was very hurtful and very problematic for them on many levels.”\n\nThe SEALs began throwing up “bureaucratic roadblocks” in an attempt to delay or defeat the effort to upgrade Chapman’s Air Force Cross, the former Air Force official says. “There was a tremendous push [by the Air Force] to get this done by the end of the [Obama] administration,” says Gabe Camarillo, the assistant secretary of the Air Force for manpower and reserve affairs from January 2016 to January 2017. If President Barack Obama left office without awarding Chapman the medal, “there wasn’t any confidence that this wouldn’t die on the vine,” he says. Air Force officials held meeting after meeting with each other and with their counterparts in the office of the secretary of defense throughout 2016, breaking through one logjam after another. But just as it seemed Chapman’s package had a chance of getting to the White House in time, Pentagon bureaucrats intervened.\n\nStaff in the office of Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine noticed that the SEALs had never signed their original witness statements for Chapman’s Air Force Cross. Those statements were part of the upgrade package. Levine and his staff were keen to get them signed, particularly because the Chapman case was otherwise “unprecedented” in its reliance on technical intelligence, rather than eyewitnesses, James says. “So the appropriate people contacted these individuals and asked them to sign their words of 15 years ago,” James recalls. But after “a couple of months” of waiting for the SEALs, “they refused,” she claims. (Camarillo, the former Air Force assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs, confirms this account.) “That’s when things broke down, and the SEALs...realized that, ‘Oh, we can take a stand and maybe thwart this thing,’” says the former combat controller. (One Mako 30 SEAL says he was not aware of this development, and that he had never been asked for such a statement after the battle, let alone refused to sign one. Newsweek verified the existence of statements from three of his teammates and attempted to reach out to them, but was unable to speak to them.)\n\nFor Air Force officials, the SEALs’ alleged refusal to sign their witness statements represented a turning point. “I guess that’s when it really clicked in my mind, Yep, there is something more going on here, and what a shame,” James says. In frustration, Air Force officials explained what was happening to Levine’s staff, who finally allowed the package to proceed without the signatures. But valuable time had been lost.\n\nSEAL Team 6 and Naval Special Warfare Command each opposed the Air Force’s effort to upgrade Chapman’s award based on events after the SEALs retreated, according to multiple sources. Rear Admiral Tim Szymanski, who as head of Naval Special Warfare Command oversees all SEAL units, was in the thick of the debate. “The biggest advocate for Slabinski was Szymanski,” says a Navy officer familiar with the awards controversy. But Szymanski had a personal stake in how the Takur Ghar story was told. He had been Team 6’s director of operations during Anaconda, helping run Mako 30’s mission from Bagram. Slabinski has told others that when he arrived back at Bagram, bruised and exhausted from the ordeal, Szymanski was the only person to hug him and tell him he’d done a good job. Since that moment, a close bond developed between the two, says a former senior Team 6 officer who knows both men. “Ski was always very confident in Slab, and he was always very proud of him,” the former senior Team 6 officer says. “You could tell it was a good relationship.”\n\nThe way Szymanski saw it, “the Air Force was trying to come against the Navy and kind of shame Slab,” the former senior Team 6 officer says, and he was determined to stick up for him. “His point was, ‘That dude [Slabinski] did everything humanly possible…. Not on your life are you going to fucking try to get Chappy [an award] which hurts Slab.’ And so I think he [ended up] doubling down to help Slab, because if Chappy gets it, the unspoken word is, ‘Well, who left him behind?’”\n\nBut Szymanski’s fierce defense of Slabinski required the SEAL admiral to oppose any public acknowledgment of what the Air Force, in its study of the incident, called “Material Finding 2,” which said that Chapman fought on after the SEALs left him behind. “I just don’t know how you advocate for Slabinski and be accepting of…Finding 2,” says the Navy officer familiar with the controversy. Indeed, throughout 2016, the SEALs tried to persuade the Air Force and then Carter’s office to justify Chapman’s upgrade solely on the basis of his actions before the SEALs left the mountain, Camarillo says. According to former Air Force officials, by December 2016, with the package finally on Carter’s desk, the SEALs’ argument was apparently gaining traction at U.S. Special Operations Command, which doesn’t make the final decision but is allowed input.\n\nThat month, says a former senior Air Force official, Thomas, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told General David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, that he had changed his mind about giving Chapman’s upgrade package his full support. According to two former Air Force officials, Thomas said he was more than willing to support an upgrade based on Chapman’s actions up to the moment the SEALs retreated, but he wanted the Air Force to drop the second part of Chapman’s citation, which summarized his actions after the SEALs withdrew. (Navy Captain Jason Salata, a spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, referred all questions about his command’s role in the Medal of Honor process to the office of the secretary of defense.)\n\nTo James’s disappointment, the former senior Air Force official says, Goldfein told her he had granted Thomas’s request, worried that doing otherwise would mire the upgrade effort in months of debate. The Air Force was running out of time with the Obama administration, and Goldfein thought acceding to Thomas gave the service a better chance of securing Chapman’s upgrade. (Through a spokesperson, Goldfein declined to comment for this story.)\n\nJames was upset at the way Thomas had circumvented her, but there was little she could do, the former senior Air Force official says. A few weeks before Trump’s inauguration, the defense secretary signed Chapman’s upgrade package. James pleaded with the White House to fast-track the process, but it was too late. Getting it through the National Security Council and onto the president’s desk, as well as the logistical challenge of arranging the multiple ceremonies that are standard when the commander-in-chief presents the nation’s highest award for valor, required more time. As the Trump administration took office, the Chapman package returned to the Pentagon for another review.\n\n“It got bounced back,” says James, who blamed the SEALs’ alleged stalling tactics for the failure to get the award approved in time. “A hundred percent, it caused that delay.”\n\nAs a political appointee, James left the Pentagon at the end of the Obama administration. As she departed, she called Chapman’s mother to tell her that her son’s package had been returned to the Pentagon. James chokes up at the memory of the conversation. “But I thought to myself, ‘Well, surely, surely, surely under General Mattis, it’ll go back quickly,’” she recalls.\n\nYet again, her optimism was misplaced.\n\nShortly before Trump’s inauguration, the Navy surprised close observers of the Chapman upgrade saga. As part of the awards review directed by Carter, the service recommended that Slabinski’s Navy Cross also be upgraded to a Medal of Honor. A Mako 30 SEAL says he first heard confirmation of the Navy’s intent in mid-January 2017, but that he had surmised it from rumors some months earlier. From what he heard from other SEALs later, it seemed the Navy viewed this as a quid pro quo for Chapman’s upgrade. “It started to become, ‘We’re either giving two or giving none,’” the Mako 30 SEAL says. (He also thought the Navy would have recommended an upgrade for Slabinski even if the Air Force had not tried to do the same for Chapman. Slabinski deserved it, and the review gave the Navy the opportunity to make it happen, he says.)\n\nWhen word of the Navy’s plan spread through the special ops community, some were shocked. “It’s just incredulous that they award him with the Medal of Honor,” says a retired special operations official intimately familiar with the battle. “Slab was completely at fault for everything that happened that night.”\n\nHe and others suggested that the Navy’s move was a direct reaction to the Air Force’s effort on behalf of Chapman. “They can’t stop Chapman’s package,” says Mike, the former targeting analyst. “So now they’re trying to save face.”\n\nEven members of Slabinski’s own service were taken aback. Up to this point, the Navy’s Takur Ghar “narrative” had been “Slab got a Navy Cross for his valor that night; he didn’t leave anybody behind,” says the Navy officer familiar with the awards controversy. “It was never: What Slab did was worthy of the Medal of Honor.”\n\nOutgoing Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, the last stop in the Navy’s approval chain for the upgrade, did not return phone calls seeking comment for this story. Thomas Oppel, who served as his chief of staff, says that while he and Mabus were aware of “opinions about this that differed on whether Slabinski was deserving of this award,” it was not a major topic of discussion with Mabus, who approved the upgrade and forwarded it to Carter’s office.\n\nThe Air Force decided not to oppose Slabinski’s Medal of Honor recommendation. “The Air Force has never said a negative word about Slabinski,” James says. “Everybody believes he did his best.”\n\nNonetheless, the Navy’s move created a conundrum for the Pentagon. As the former combat controller puts it: “How can one man earn a Medal of Honor saving everyone else’s life, and the second guy—whose life was saved by the first, as he acknowledges in his witness statement, and who then makes the decision to leave the first guy for dead—also earn the nation’s highest medal?”\n\nThe answer, according to a former defense official, was that just like Slabinski’s Navy Cross, the upgrade would cover not just the firefight on the peak, but his bravery in leading his team back to Takur Ghar to try to rescue Roberts, and then in shepherding the survivors down the mountain to safety. It was the totality of Slabinski’s actions that persuaded Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson that he was worthy of the Medal of Honor, the former defense official says: “Given the harrowing situation he found himself in, his being able to lead the rest of the team to safety after losing two to enemy fire and having two more grievously wounded went above and beyond the call of duty.”\n\nBut perhaps sensitive to the argument articulated by the former combat controller, the SEALs continued to object to the Air Force’s insistence that Chapman had survived beyond their departure. As a former senior Air Force official puts it: “They were still really putting up roadblocks.”\n\n‘You’ll Throw Him Under the Bus’\n\nUp to mid-2016, the SEALs seem to have portrayed Chapman’s actions before they allegedly left him for dead as heroic. But by that fall, they had started to change their stance in their efforts to resist the Air Force’s attempt to upgrade the airman’s award. In this new version of events, Chapman’s actions in the moments after the helicopter landed were the result of him disobeying Slabinski’s order to immediately find cover and contact the gunship overhead, so it could fire in support of the team. “Basically, they were on the cusp of getting in…, and he just took off running, guns blazing, totally off-book, off script, glory-seeking, whatever,” says the Navy officer familiar with the controversy. “That was the way it was conveyed to me.”\n\nA JSOC memo obtained by Newsweek regarding Chapman’s potential upgrade includes a note appended by a Team 6 representative on September 21, 2016, that articulates this line of argument. “The actions were inconsistent with the orders given TSgt Chapman,” reads the note. “[H]e neglected his primary responsibility of establishing comms with air support, which had he consolidated initially with the team and established comms, would have enabled positive identification of the team, their location and allowed for CAS [close air support] fires which could have saved Chapman and prevented the wounding of the other two team members.”\n\nThis new tack incensed Chapman’s supporters, who saw it as a desperate attempt to derail his award. “That became their position when nothing else was working,” says the former combat controller. “From the Air Force side of the equation, our disappointment at that point is absolute. Because it’s like, you guys, in order to protect your image, will sully the legacy of a man who you all agreed saved everyone’s life 15 years ago, but now to protect the [SEAL] brand you’ll throw him under the bus.”\n\nThe SEALs’ alleged attempt to change the narrative about Chapman’s initial actions also failed to persuade senior Pentagon officials who would ultimately make the decision whether or not to forward the recommendation to the White House. As one puts it, “There were some people who said, ‘Hey, he wasn’t supposed to go to the left; he was supposed to go to the right,’ to which we all said, ‘The damn enemy was to the left. He went towards the sound of the guns, so shut up!’”\n\nA Mako 30 SEAL says he does not recall anyone accusing Chapman of failing to obey orders, and that as far as he knew, the SEALs didn’t have any issues with recognizing him for his heroism “up until the point Chapman was shot.” But, he adds, the airman’s alleged actions after that point were “what the Air Force was using to get him the upgrade.” That rankled Chapman’s Mako 30 teammates, who remain unconvinced by the Air Force’s argument that their colleague survived after they retreated. “The way they pieced it together,” the Mako 30 SEAL says, “it didn’t add up.”\n\nDefense Secretary Mattis directed his deputy, retired Marine Colonel Bob Work, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine General Joseph Dunford to evaluate the merits of both nominations. They convened a series of contentious high-level meetings in the Pentagon.\n\nThe unique nature of the Chapman case was the principal factor that once again delayed the process, according to a former defense official familiar with the discussions. Senior Pentagon officials were concerned that there were no eyewitness accounts of Chapman’s heroism.\n\nOne constant in the discussions: the institutional allegiances of the different special operations “tribes” and the direct connections of several key leaders to the Takur Ghar fight. In addition to Thomas and Szymanski, Army General Joe Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, also had a personal stake in the mountaintop struggle. At the time of the battle he commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment, which meant he was Thomas’s boss. The Rangers who died were his men as well. The Team 6 commander from 2015 to 2017 had also worked for Szymanski at Bagram during Anaconda. As a result, says a former defense official, “there were no completely objective observers in this entire thing.”\n\nAs the two packages worked their way through the system, some military officials expressed concern about several questionable episodes in Slabinski’s past. Federal law states that a service member cannot receive the Medal of Honor “if his service after he distinguished himself has not been honorable.”\n\nSlabinski had been associated with at least three controversial incidents since Takur Ghar, according to a January 2017 article in The Intercept about alleged Team 6 transgressions. The article included an audio file of a segment of an interview Slabinski conducted with author Malcolm MacPherson for his book Roberts Ridge, which tells the Takur Ghar story from Slabinski’s perspective. In the interview, Slabinski recounts a mission in 2002, not long after the Takur Ghar fight, and describes shooting at the corpse of an enemy fighter he knew was dead, just to watch the body jerk as the bullets hit it. A former special operations officer who has heard Slabinski discuss the same incident said it sounded to him like it could be construed as “a war crime.”\n\nThe other two episodes occurred during a 2007-2008 deployment to Afghanistan. In one, Slabinski told his men before a mission that he wanted “a head on a platter,” according to The Intercept. Slabinski and others later said he was speaking metaphorically, but one of his men appeared to try to saw a dead militant’s head off. (Slabinski later told The New York Times he ordered the operator to stop what he was doing.) The Naval Criminal Investigative Service looked into it, but closed the case after finding no evidence the SEALs had broken the laws of armed conflict.\n\nShortly thereafter, Slabinski’s squadron was involved in another contentious incident when local elders accused the SEALs of killing every man they saw during a mission. A former senior Team 6 member told The New York Times that Slabinski, the squadron’s senior enlisted man, had directed the operators to kill every adult male they encountered on the raid. Slabinski denied giving any such guidance, and a JSOC investigation found no wrongdoing. “The allegations in the Intercept article were looked into by Naval Special Warfare Command when that article was published,” a Navy official tells Newsweek. “No allegations of misconduct were ever found to be credible.”\n\nAlthough the Intercept article covered all three episodes, only the 2002 incident was raised to the attention of the Pentagon officials considering whether to forward Slabinski’s Medal of Honor recommendation to the White House. As one puts it, “We were aware of the audio file where Slab admitted to shooting a corpse. However, we were told he had not been subject to any disciplinary action. After careful consideration, it was decided that it was not something that should prevent Slabinski receiving the nation’s highest award for valor.” Nonetheless, the officials flagged the issue when they sent the recommendation forward. “We wanted to make sure that those who would make the final decision were aware of the incident,” a former defense official says.\n\nHowever, a former senior Team 6 officer says, a Medal of Honor for his actions during the Takur Ghar fight would force Slabinski to repeatedly relive an extraordinarily traumatic episode he has tried to put behind him. In 2016, Slabinski told The New York Times that he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and still saw “visions” of figures moving in slow motion on Takur Ghar. “I don’t think he really wanted this thing,” says the former senior Team 6 officer. Yet Slabinski has reluctantly accepted that it’s his “duty” to accept the award if the president signs off on it, he adds. “He’s going to be the quiet professional and represent it the best he can.”\n\nBy July, Dunford and Work recommended that the awards for both Slabinski and Chapman be upgraded to Medals of Honor. Mattis forwarded both packages to the White House in the fall. If Trump approves the awards, it will mark only the second time in the post-9/11 era that two Medals of Honor have been awarded for actions during the same battle, says awards expert Sterner, an Army veteran with two combat tours in Vietnam.\n\nDespite the efforts of the SEALs and U.S. Special Operations Command, when Chapman’s award citation went to the White House, it included a reference to his lonely fight after the Mako 30 survivors had retreated. Work ultimately reinserted that language, James says. However, another source tells Newsweek that much of the detail pertaining to Chapman’s actions during that period will be classified, “because of the technical intelligence that was involved.”\n\nThis news, already known to some insiders, fed perceptions that the Pentagon was trying to protect the SEALs’ reputation. “It’s part of accommodating SEAL Team 6,” says the former combat controller. “It allows them to sort of obfuscate things.”\n\nChapman’s sister, Lori Longfritz, says her priority is seeing her brother recognized for his heroism, not the politics that has surrounded the effort to upgrade his award. “I just want John to get what he deserved to be awarded back in January of ’03,” she tells Newsweek. “What happens outside of that, I don’t care.”\n\nSpokesmen for U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command were mum about whether their bosses had concurred with the upgrades for Chapman and Slabinski. However, a defense official says U.S. Special Operations Command did not concur with the Slabinski upgrade, but did for Chapman’s, only on the basis of his actions before the SEALs withdrew.\n\nThere was a late effort to persuade Mattis not to approve Slabinski’s upgrade, according to a senior Pentagon official. “There is some unease about the Navy’s push to upgrade, and some people have expressed doubt…as to whether it’s truly worthy of a Medal of Honor,” the official says. “A couple of people have tried to slow it down, but the train seems to have left the station, unless the White House decides otherwise.”\n\nHistorically, once a Medal of Honor package reaches the White House, it is virtually assured of approval, says Sterner. However, the Trump administration has yet to make an announcement regarding either package. “[Defense Department] policy is not to comment on the status of pending Medal of Honor nominations until the award is announced by the White House or the medal is awarded by the president,” says Eastburn, the Pentagon spokesman.\n\n“The reputational aspect of all this” may be why the White House is taking so long to approve the awards, says a former defense official. In other words, the Trump administration may be preparing for blowback. “When you’re asking the president to award the Medal of Honor, you want to make sure that he understands, ‘Look, this will be viewed as controversial by some people and may play out in the press in ways that detract from the heroism of both men,’” the former official says.\n\nAny debate over the validity of the awards would be unfair to the men being recognized, says Sterner. “There should be no controversy here,” he says. “Awarding both of these men the Medal of Honor does nothing to take away from the prestige of the award and everything to highlight the true heroism of two very, very dedicated servicemen.”\n\nSenior Pentagon officials ultimately reached the same conclusion. “I’m sorry it took so long and there was such a contentious debate, but I’m satisfied in the end the right decision was made,” says the former defense official. “Both Slab and Chappy were courageous warriors who rated a Medal of Honor.”\n\nThis by no means guarantees unanimous opinion among officials who have watched the process play out over the past two years. “The soil is pretty freaking soggy for us to really stand firm on any of these,” says the Navy officer familiar with the controversy. Meanwhile, he adds, the Pentagon is trying to silence the naysayers. Mattis’s office has “made it pretty clear that ‘If and when this thing moves, we don’t want to hear any dissenting voices or side-chatter.’”\n\nThat may be a vain hope. “I know how bad this story can be,” the officer says of the potential fallout. Which makes him wonder: “Why are we even walking into this buzz saw?”\n\nSean D.

And true to her daring self, the superstar went all out. After all, she was born for this red carpet.\n\nAs someone who’s already dressed “Like a Virgin,” she went in the opposite direction with her Jean Paul Gaultier look and collaborated with stylist Eyob Yohannes on her Met moment, which he describes in three words as: ” Immaculate Goth Queen.”\n\n“The religious theme most certainly played into the look however we wanted to put a twist on it so we decided to make it all black,” Yohannes tells PEOPLE exclusively. “Madonna has always woven in religion and spirituality into her music and image throughout her career. This years theme could not have better suited her.”\n\nHer black ball gown featured a fitted bodice and a sheer cross cutout, a full ball skirt, black veil, cross-adorned crown and she finished the look off carrying a black flower in her hand.\n\n“Madonna and Jean Paul have had quite a history together so it was a wonderful family reunion and quite the fashion throwback,” Yohannes said. “It was lovely to work with Jean Paul who has such a creative eye.”\n\nThis year’s theme celebrates an exhibit showcasing 40 pieces on loan from the Vatican as well as designs from Coco Chanel, John Galliano and Cristóbal Balenciaga that spotlight the influence religious iconography has on fashion.

The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT\u0026T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.\n\nDisney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox’s film, television and international businesses, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nComcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.\n\nLast November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows.\n\nFox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast’s bid, even though they did not reference it by name.\n\nThe exact value of Comcast’s new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer.\n\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment.\n\nFox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.\n\nMurdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer.\n\nLast month’s regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.\n\nComcast’s stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.\n\nDisney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.\n\nIn its deal with Disney, Fox agreed to separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.","author":"Greg Roumeliotis","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T00:23:56.000Z"},"source":{"id":"reuters","name":"Reuters"},"urlToImage":"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02\u0026d=20180507\u0026t=2\u0026i=1259546044\u0026w=1200\u0026r=LYNXMPEE461NZ","digest":"C2CPI11EVqWlG9xiAs+rtw==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5af11dfc5a90676be2aa397a"},"description":"A string of courtroom setbacks for the special counsel \u0026quot;makes our job a little bit easier,” Rudy Giuliani says.","title":"Mueller's courtroom bruises cheer Trump team","url":"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/07/trump-mueller-russia-probe-judges-573221","text":"Special counsel Robert Mueller seemingly enjoyed free rein over the last year in his investigation into President Donald Trump’s campaign connections to the Kremlin, arresting suspects, winning plea deals and handing down indictments at will.\n\nMuch to the merriment of the president and his lawyers, Mueller’s prosecutors have met their first real resistance in the form of skeptical judges. While the courtroom setbacks have not derailed Mueller’s criminal cases, they have fueled questions about their strength. And given the intense scrutiny of Mueller’s work, even small hitches are welcome news for a White House looking for evidence that the Russia probe has gone too far.\n\n“It makes our job a little bit easier,” Trump’s top personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in an interview Monday.\n\nTwo federal judges have now questioned Mueller’s authority to bring charges on matters unrelated to the presidential election, including alleged financial crimes by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. On Saturday, a third judge rebuffed Mueller’s request to delay proceedings involving three Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens he has indicted for meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n“The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice,” Trump tweeted Monday — a reference to the number of Mueller’s 17 prosecutors who are registered Democrats.\n\nMueller’s team is unlikely to feel a sense of crisis, former prosecutors said in interviews. That’s because it is still early in the process of trying Manafort, who is fighting the charges in two federal courts. (One of his trials is scheduled to begin on July 10, the other in September.) And they can take solace in the knowledge that skeptical comments from a judge don’t necessarily predict an eventual ruling.\n\n“Prosecutors charge, defendants try to poke holes, and prosecutors respond, then judges decide. The only difference in this affair is that the defense has the world’s largest megaphone,” said Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor and Duke University law school professor. “People should get used it to — and, more importantly, not fall for these lame spin efforts that attempt to play off of the public’s unfamiliarity with the litigation process.”\n\n“I don’t think he is going to change his strategy now,” added Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney from eastern Michigan. “If he were to worry about every minor setback, he might end up pulling punches when he should be striking hard blows.”\n\nBut none of that is keeping the president’s team from getting excited.\n\nDuring a Friday speech at a National Rifle Association gathering, Trump gleefully read aloud several quotes from U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III, who earlier in the day had questioned whether Mueller’s prosecutors, in bringing tax and bank fraud crimes brought against Manafort in Virginia, were pursuing alleged crimes unrelated to Mueller’s original mandate: investigating Russian election interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.\n\nAnd in his latest departure from past protocol, under which presidents rarely singled out federal judges by name, Trump praised Ellis in his remarks as “really something very special.”\n\nIn his interview with POLITICO, Giuliani called Ellis’s questions fodder for any potential legal fight over Mueller’s desire for a sit-down interview with Trump. “It shows the concern that the president has raised that this is a witch hunt,” Giuliani said. “The judge’s observation was — and they had no good answer for him — that they’re just going after Manafort, they’re not even interested in Manafort, all they want to do is kind of trap the president. So that’s really important to us because we don’t want him trapped.”\n\n“It’s good to have an independent member of the judiciary point that out,” Giuliani added.\n\nThe former New York mayor and 2008 presidential aspirant also said the criticism of Mueller’s actions could drive Republican turnout in November.\n\n“If they continue to get hit for prosecutorial misconduct it will probably help” motivate GOP voters to the polls, Giuliani said. “His people are much more incensed than they were before we got involved.”\n\nTrump-friendly media outlets have also hyped the recent judicial outtakes. The Daily Caller on Monday ran a story describing Ellis, an appointee of Ronald Reagan, as “the ultimate nightmare” for Mueller. On Saturday, the Drudge Report featured a POLITICO report about U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich’s weekend decision to deny Mueller’s request to delay an arraignment scheduled for Wednesday; the case involves one three Russian companies Mueller indicted in February for using Internet trolls, social media ads and other techniques to politically divide Americans in 2016.\n\nVeteran law enforcement experts say Mueller’s team is unfazed by the preliminary court moves and any criticism that Trump and his lawyers are launching.\n\nMueller faces no deadline in his investigation, though he has an interest in moving quickly: Trump and his GOP allies have stepped up their attacks on the Russia probe and are trying to turn the 2018 midterms into a fight about impeachment.\n\nGiuliani over the weekend said Trump is considering fighting a subpoena from Mueller aimed at forcing his testimony. That court fight could drag on for months as it winds its way to the Supreme Court, which a former senior Trump strategist said would be a welcome political development.\n\n“You’ve got to bide time,” said the GOP strategist. “You’ve got to get to November.”\n\nMueller has some notable legal wins under his belt: Early in the Manfort case, he defeated attempts to block his subpoena power and limit who he can question as a potential witness. He has also secured guilty pleas from the former Trump aides and advisors Michael Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopolous.\n\nBut things soured at a court hearing in Washington last month, when U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson suggested that a May 2017 order from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein establishing Mueller’s probe violated Justice Department regulations by granting him the broad authority to pursue matters that “may arise” from his inquiry into Russian election meddling.\n\n“One of the problems you’ve identified with…the appointment order is that it’s impossible to give a new prosecutor a specific factual statement of any matters that ‘arose or may arise’ in this investigation,” Jackson told Manafort’s lawyers. “That’s a fair point with respect to the future.\n\nOn Friday, Ellis, the judge handling Mueller’s case against Manafort in Virginia, went even further bysuggesting that Manafort’s alleged bank fraud and money laundering are too dated to be relevant to Mueller’s core mission.\n\n“They all long predate any contact or any affiliation of this defendant with the campaign. So, I don’t see what relation this indictment has with anything the special prosecutor is authorized to investigate,” Ellis said. “This indictment didn’t ‘arise’ from your investigation.”\n\nAt one point, a prickly Ellis even accused longtime Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben of trying to dodge the issue. “You’re running away from my question again,” the judge complained. Ellis even grilled Dreeben about Mueller’s budget\n\nIn the Russian troll case, the St. Petersburg-based firm, Concord Management and Consulting, has hired American defense lawyers and is seeking painstakingly detailed information on the case against the company as well as two other firms and 13 individuals. Among those charged is Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s chef and is a wealth entrepreneur behind Concord.\n\nWhen Rosenstein announced the indictment earlier this year, it was widely seen as a “name-and-shame” case, meaning that the individuals and companies charged were all but certain to never show up in court to defend themselves.\n\nHowever, it now seems that Concord can appear, through its attorneys — risking little but legal fees while potentially using the court’s discovery process to gain access to a trove of sensitive information.\n\nLegal experts say that Friedrich’s ruling could force Mueller’s team to decide whether it wants to wrestle with the risks of discovery just to make a largely symbolic point against a Russia-based company.\n\nIf not, Mueller could simply decide to drop Concord as a defendant in the case — at the cost of another public relations embarrassment.\n\nWhile Trump’s team may be enjoying Mueller’s occasional legal stumble, veterans of past special counsel cases say that would be premature.\n\n“Let them celebrate,” Sol Wisenberg, a former deputy prosecutor on Kenneth Starr’s investigation into President Bill Clinton, said of the president and his attorneys. “But there’s a big difference between a not guilty verdict and a judge making comments that are negative.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/darrensamuelsohn","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T00:12:59.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/bb/b4/6c57a62b49328bd95765de563f89/180501-robert-mueller-gty-1-1160.jpg","digest":"YVEkNkdpPGvegq/IUB2MoA==\n"}

The property had a gated circular driveway, with a renovated house hidden on a two-acre grove of mature fruit trees.\n\n“I’d been looking aggressively in, specifically, Leilani Estates,” said Wiggers, who moved to the island in 2011 and works as a tour guide at nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. “I thought, this is exactly what I want, but there’s no way on earth I’ll be able to afford it.”\n\nWiggers was in luck, however. Shortly after he drove by, that house went on the market — and was in his price range. He jumped on it, and to his surprise, his offer was accepted.\n\nThe fact that it all sat atop the gentle slopes of Kilauea, the world’s longest-erupting volcano — inside the most hazardous of nine island zones for lava flows, no less — didn’t faze him.\n\n“The last lava flow to come through here was a long time ago, so I didn’t think there was any threat whatsoever,” Wiggers told The Washington Post, referring to the Leilani Estates neighborhood. “I’m a bit of a risk taker.”\n\nNearly four years later, whether his risk was worth it remains to be seen. An increase in volcanic activity has forced nearly a dozen vents to open in the subdivision, bringing with it spewing lava, historic earthquakes and toxic gas that has rendered parts of the once-serene residential area unrecognizable.\n\nOn April 30, the floor of a crater on top of the Kilauea volcano collapsed, sending its pool of lava back underground and causing a series of small earthquakes. Scientists predicted the magma would travel elsewhere and push its way back to the surface somewhere in the East Rift Zone.\n\nDays later, the ground split open on the east end of Leilani Estates, exposing an angry red beneath the lush landscape. From the widening gash, molten rock burbled and splashed, then shot dozens of feet in the air.\n\nThe Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency called it “active volcanic fountaining.” Some residents said it was Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, coming to reclaim her land. About 1,700 Leilani Estates residents were ordered to evacuate amid threats of fires and “extremely high levels of dangerous” sulfur dioxide gas.\n\nSoon, another such fissure had formed a few streets to the west. Then another, and another. For days, hot steam and noxious gases rose from the vents, before magma broke through, with some lava fountains shooting as high as 330 feet into the air — taller than the tip of the Statue of Liberty torch.\n\nAs of Monday, at least 10 fissures were reported in Leilani Estates, according to the county civil defense agency. Lava spouted along the vents and oozed through the neighborhood, leaving lines of smoldering trees in its wake and igniting cars and buildings.\n\nSo far, lava has destroyed at least 35 structures, 26 of which were homes, the agency said Monday.\n\nOfficials say more outbreaks are likely to occur along the rift zone, and it’s unclear so far how long they will continue or where new fissures might form.\n\n“It’s kind of like a water pipe bursting underground. The pipe might burst in several places, but the water’s going to find the easiest pathway to get out, not necessarily above every single hole in the pipe,” said Tracy Gregg, an associate professor of geology at the University of Buffalo who has worked on Kilauea.\n\nShe said the fact that there are still eruptions from so many new fissures forming suggests the lava is from a new batch of magma rising from deep within the volcano.\n\n“We don’t have a good idea of how big it is and how long it’ll last,” Gregg said. “It could be a couple of days, a couple of weeks. It could be a couple of months. We just have to wait and see.”\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of evacuees have been waiting it out at local churches, Red Cross shelters or elsewhere on the island, wondering when — or if — they can return home.\n\nAt least one resident found out her home had burned through a video circulating online.\n\nAmber Makuakane, 37, an elementary school teacher and single mother of two, told Hawaii News Now she was struggling with how to break the news to her children that lava had destroyed their three-bedroom home in Leilani Estates after spotting its remains in aerial footage.\n\nMakuakane noted tearfully that she had grown up nearby and had lived in the neighborhood for nine years, along with her parents.\n\n“The volcano and the lava — it’s always been a part of my life,” Makuakane told the Associated Press. “It’s devastating … but I’ve come to terms with it.”\n\nEven among evacuees, the attitude toward Kilauea’s latest outbursts has seemed to be a blend of sadness, acceptance and, for some, deference to Mother Nature. In interviews and in online forums, several residents have invoked Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess said to live inside Kilauea, when asked about the fate of their homes.\n\n“What can you do? You have no control over it,” Leilani Estates resident Steve Clapper told the AP on Monday morning at an evacuation shelter. “Pele’s the boss, you know.”\n\nOver the weekend, residents placed ti leaves in some of the cracks in the roads, meant as a sacred offering to Pele.\n\n“The way I kind of look at it is, the land doesn’t really belong to us. It belongs to Pele,” Jordan Sonner, a Big Island Realtor who evacuated her home near Leilani Estates, told The Post on Saturday. “We get to live on it while we can, and if she wants it back, she’ll take it. I have good insurance.”\n\nThe lava, many residents said, was an integral part of the life there, to be dealt with like heavy snowfall in Upstate New York or humidity in Florida. The nearby national park, perhaps, is where the power of the lava — and the volcano from which it comes — is treated with the most deference.\n\n“During a volcanic eruption, we are reminded that our planet is an ever-changing environment whose basic processes are beyond human control,” the park’s website states. “As much as we have altered the face of the Earth to suit our needs, we can only stand in awe before the power of an eruption.”\n\nStill, a handful of residents have refused to budge.\n\n“I won’t leave until it’s an inch from my house,” Leilani Estates resident Greg Webber told USA Today. “I’ve been through this a million times.”\n\nLikewise, Scott Wiggers, the tour guide who purchased his dream home in 2014, now sits and waits inside it, on the western edge of Leilani Estates, about two miles away from the nearest fissure.\n\nUnlike most residents there — and despite a mandatory evacuation order — he has chosen to stay because, in his opinion, his home is safely outside of the northeast-southwest line along which the fissures have been forming.\n\nHe has spent his time posting videos of the lava flows to YouTube and fielding requests from evacuated neighbors to check on their homes. In one of his videos, lava overtakes a house near one of the fissures, igniting it. In another, he stops as he sees gas wafting up from cracks in the road.\n\n“It’s just awesome to see the Earth alive right in front of you,” Wiggers said. “Even inside Volcanoes National Park, when we’re exploring past lava flows … I still get goosebumps every time.”\n\nThe county civil defense agency on Sunday announced certain Leilani Estates residents could return briefly to their homes to retrieve pets, medicine or important items left behind — but would need to leave immediately afterward because of “the very unstable conditions of air quality and of the roads.” But on Monday, officials said no one would be allowed to return after all because conditions were too unstable.\n\nThey continued to urge residents to evacuate, given a triple whammy of threats: lava spewing forth from below; earthquakes — including the strongest to hit Hawaii in more than four decades — jolting the Big Island’s residents; and noxious fumes in the air.\n\n“Being in Hawaii and being around lava, you get used to the way it behaves and so you kind of become comfortable around it,” said Wendy Stovall, a volcanologist with the Geological Survey. The lava flows “are mesmerizing to see. I understand why people want to see them, but it’s not advisable. It’s a dangerous situation.”\n\nThe county civil defense agency put it more bluntly: “This is not the time for sightseeing. You can help tremendously by staying out of the area.”\n\nHawaii’s silent danger: Volcanic smog, otherwise known as ‘vog’\n\nHawaii might be about to ban your favorite sunscreen to protect its coral reefs\n\nHawaii missile alert: How one employee ‘pushed the wrong button’ and caused a wave of panic","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T23:09:46.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FGKRCVkqMaB_jrnF2EWO2nlyKEw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DIVH5XLSVE4YRJM36PI7HET4J4.jpg","digest":"3HUAVjodBk+ubIwRnwPT/g==\n"}

The two memos were part of 1,700 pages of documents turned over at the request of South Carolina's Gowdy. The documents include vouchers for all of Pruitt's official travel since he was confirmed and for EPA, vouchers for staff who went on international trips to Italy and Morocco, emails regarding Pruitt's lease of a room from a lobbyist's wife, and EPA correspondence between that lobbyist and other employees of his firm. Lobbyist involved in plans for two foreign trips for Pruitt In addition, Gowdy's office was able to review travel vouchers for members of Pruitt's security detail, according to his office. The flights are among several alleged ethical transgressions or questionable spending practices that have landed Pruitt in the spotlight of multiple investigative bodies, including Gowdy's committee, the EPA inspector general, and the Government Accountability Office. Gowdy's request for the waivers was prompted by a Politico article from February in which Wilcox said Pruitt was granted a \"blanket waiver\" to travel in first class for security reasons. The next day, Wilcox's story changed. Politico reported that federal regulations specifically prohibit \"blanket authorization, and Wilcox changed his statement, saying a waiver was submitted \"for every trip.\" While the EPA has not provided detailed waivers, it has handed over more than 1,700 pages of documents in response to multiple requests relating to Pruitt's travel habits, unprecedented security, and sweetheart condo deal from an energy lobbyist, according to Gowdy's office. But one memo indicates there was only one request for a waiver. It's dated May 1, 2017, and is a request from the acting security chief that Pruitt \"be strategically seated in business and or first class seating when on official travel.\" \"We have observed and (sic) increased awareness and at times lashing out from passengers which occurs while the Administrator is seated in coach with PSD (Protective Services Detail) not easily accessible to him due to uncontrolled full flights,\" the memo reads. \"Therefore, we believe that the continued use of coach seats for the Administrator would endanger his life,\" the memo continues. Dems say Pruitt aide asked EPA to consider opening office in Pruitt's hometown The second memo is a response from Acting Controller Jeanne Conklin, whose office oversees compliance with spending regulations. Conklin wrote she \"determined your request complies with criteria\" for allowing first or business class seats, and pointed the Administrator's office to a specific paragraph of government travel regulations. That paragraph states upgraded travel is allowed if \"use of coach-class accommodations would endanger your life or Government property.\" That regulation also requires the justification for upgraded seats be prepared for each trip. \"Blanket authorization of other than coach-class transportation accommodations is prohibited and shall be authorized on an individual trip-by-trip basis, unless the traveler has an up-to-date documented disability or special need,\" the regulation reads.

They threaten to impeach Mueller's boss, who in turn accuses them of “extortion.” One has even likened the Russia probe to a possible “coup d’etat.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump calls them his \"warriors\": a band of four House Republicans defending Trump with a relentless counterattack against the Justice Department’s Russia investigation that thrills the president even as it unsettles some House GOP colleagues who think they’re going too far.\n\nThis crew of hard-charging conservatives, whom Trump singled out by name in late April, have emerged as some of Washington’s most prominent Republicans, enjoying direct lines to the Trump White House and flights on Air Force One.\n\n\"Look, we have some absolute warriors,\" Trump told Fox News on April 26 when asked about his relationship with Congress, name-checking \"Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz and [Ron] DeSantis.”\n\nTheir emergence underscores a reality of the Trump era: power and prominence on Capitol Hill these days often flow not to the most senior lawmakers but to Republicans who display allegiance to a president who prizes loyalty. None of the four holds a powerful committee chairmanship, but they have something just as important: regular airtime on Fox News. And their pressure campaign against the Justice Department and FBI has put Mueller’s boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on the defensive.\n\nThe scorched-earth approach by the relatively junior members — only Jordan has served more than three terms — is in some ways reminiscent of the way a young GOP congressman named Newt Gingrich, joined by a group of back bench House colleagues, shocked Washington in the mid-1980s with their theatrical attacks on Democratic leaders.\n\nIt has similarly enraged liberals today, who say that Trump’s “warriors” care only about protecting the president — and may even be conspiring with him to create a pretext for firing Rosenstein.\n\nOn Thursday, the left-leaning public watchdog group Democracy21 accused Meadows and Jordan of “colluding to obstruct and potentially give Trump control over” Mueller’s probe. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, says they are “trying to sabotage” Mueller, and “want to force a confrontation with the Deputy Attorney General.”\n\n“When Mr. Rosenstein refuses to provide [requested] documents, Republicans will pounce with their transparent, dishonest articles of impeachment – unless President Trump beats them to the punch, and fires Mr. Rosenstein directly first,\" Nadler said.\n\nIt all helps explain why Gaetz, a 35-year-old freshman from Florida, routinely gets calls from the president, including critiques of his Fox News appearances, and has flown at least twice on Air Force One. In a November House floor speech, Gaetz called on Mueller to resign, warning of the “risk of a coup d'état in this country if we allow an unaccountable person with no oversight to undermine the duly-elected president of the United States.”\n\nThe 39-year-old DeSantis, who last week called for criminal investigations of former FBI director James Comey and his former deputy Andrew McCabe, won Trump’s early endorsement in Florida’s contested GOP primary for governor. He has also proposed cutting off funding for Mueller’s investigation.\n\nMeadows, 58, a North Carolinian who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, speaks with Trump on a regular basis and has been floated as a potential successor for the beleaguered White House chief of staff, John Kelly.\n\nHe and Jordan, who is vice chairman of the Freedom Caucus, have led the charge against Rod Rosenstein, against whom they have drafted articles of impeachment in response to what they call Rosenstein’s unacceptable delays in turning over documents related both to Mueller’s investigation — as well as the 2016 FBI probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, which they suspect should have resulted in criminal action against Clinton. The two men even visited the Justice Department last month for a tense face-to-face meeting in which they demanded a faster response to their document requests.\n\n\"The president’s been frustrated by some of the tactics that have been used against him,\" Gaetz said in an interview. \"I think those frustrations are well-founded in fact and I appreciate him encouraging others to join our call.\"\n\nRosenstein fired back defiantly earlier this week, without naming his critics but leaving little doubt that he was talking about Meadows and company.\n\n“I think they should understand by now that the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” Rosenstein said, citing what he called “public and private threats.”\n\n“We’re going to do what’s required by the rule of law, and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job,” he added.\n\nBut Trump’s die-hard defenders aren’t backing down. They have little reason to, given that Trump carried their districts by an average of nearly 30 points in 2016.\n\nJordan, a 54-year-old fifth-term congressman from Ohio who has been particularly loyal to Trump — he drew national attention last month for telling CNN he has never heard the president lie — said he believes the Justice Department is biased against the president and has lost sight of the principle of “equal treatment under the law.\"\n\n\"The mission statement of the House Freedom Caucus is we came here to fight for countless number of people who feel like this town’s forgotten them. The president’s come to this town to fight for folks who feel like this town has forgotten them,\" he said.\n\nThe four House Republicans have taken the lead on Russia in the weeks since the House Intelligence Committee, chaired by the Trump-friendly Rep. Devin Nunes, wrapped up its probe into Russian election interference, which featured aggressive GOP questioning of the Justice Department.\n\nJordan, Gaetz and DeSantis sit on the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Justice Department. Meadows, Jordan and DeSantis are also on the House Oversight Committee, which has broad authority to question the executive branch and has probed the FBI's handling of the 2016 Clinton investigation and other decision-making by the bureau as the Trump-Russia probe was launched.\n\nUsing his Twitter account and public comments, Trump has amplified the Republicans’ complaints about his own Justice Department's willingness to share investigative documents with Congress.\n\nIn a May 2 tweet, Trump commented on a recent demand by Jordan and Meadows that Rosenstein provide an unredacted copy of the order setting out the scope of Mueller's investigation, which could offer clues about its avenues of inquiry. The Justice Department has refused to comply.\n\n“They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of?” Trump tweeted on May 2. “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!”\n\nJustice Department officials say they carefully protect documents related to ongoing investigations as a matter of practice — citing “the longstanding position of the department that congressional inquiries pertaining to ongoing criminal investigations threaten the integrity of those investigations,” as one put it in a letter to Meadows and Jordan obtained by CBS News.\n\nTrump has issued veiled threats to fire Rosenstein, whose successor Democrats fear would seek to constrain Mueller — or even end his probe. Trump's new lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called on Rosenstein earlier this week this week to do just that, and railed without evidence against \"crimes\" he said had been committed by investigators.\n\nIn an interview, Meadows said the Justice Department took more than three weeks to respond to his request for the order defining Mueller’s probe and called it notably \"coincidental\" that it was rejected just as Trump allies in Congress began issuing calls for Rosenstein’s impeachment. He called Rosenstein's vow to not be \"extorted\" a seemingly \"well-rehearsed\" line, noting that he's had \"multiple personal conversations\" with the deputy attorney general and \"literally hundreds of calls\" to the Justice Department.\n\n\"He can’t argue with the facts,\" Meadows said. \"The facts are that we’ve had six months of asking for documents. The facts are that we have a number of subpoenas that the deadlines have come and gone. The facts are that it is only with incredible pressure that the Department of Justice actually delivers anything to Congress. And the facts are that we have a constitutional oversight responsibility that cannot be ignored.\"\n\nMeadows said he hopes to avoid an impeachment scenario. \"All I want are the documents that constitutionally we’re entitled to and certainly Rod should convey to us,\" he said. (Congress can impeach Justice Department officials but doing so requires a majority of House Republicans and a two-thirds Senate vote, which would be highly unlikely.)\n\nOn Sunday, he showed new signs of growing impatience: “Enough is enough. It's time to hold DOJ officials in contempt of Congress,” he tweeted.\n\nTo be sure, other Republicans in Congress — including some with vast power to compel the Justice Department to turn over documents — are applying their own pressure on the Justice Department and FBI. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has subpoenaed the department for records, and Nunes recently threatened to initiate contempt or impeachment proceedings against Rosenstein and FBI Director Chris Wray over withheld documents.\n\nAt the same time, House leaders, while supporting the demands for documents have been careful to emphasize that Mueller should be allowed to continue his work unimpeded. Speaker Paul Ryan has voiced support for Mueller and Rosenstein, as has Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), a key investigator who has otherwise joined in the calls for speedier access to Justice Department files.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Justice Department, historically a jealous guardian of its investigative material, has made a series of capitulations to GOP demands — in some cases making extraordinary exceptions to longstanding rules against sharing material from an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe department has provided Congress with Comey's memos documenting his interactions with Trump, considered central evidence in Mueller's obstruction probe. It also turned over the FBI file that launched the Trump-Russia probe in 2016. And in recent weeks, Attorney General Jeff Sessions — who is recused from all matters connected to the Trump and Clinton campaigns — has tapped two U.S. attorneys to speed the production of documents to Congress.\n\nSome Democrats are urging the Justice Department to fight back harder.\n\n“Releasing investigatory files during an ongoing investigation sets a disturbing precedent, and the Deputy Attorney General must be aware that no matter what he gives to these members of Congress, it will never be enough,” Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement last month.\n\n“House Republicans are spoiling to manufacture a conflict with the Justice Department that would give the President a pretext to get rid of Mueller or Rosenstein, heedless of the damage they are doing to our institutions,” he added.\n\nBut Gaetz and his allies said they are stepping up the pressure now, for fear that Justice Department officials like Rosenstein are playing a long game, hoping that — with midterm elections coming and Republicans lagging in the polls — time is on their side.\n\n\"I worry that there may be some people at the Department of Justice and the FBI who think they can wait us out, who think that Democrats will retake the majority and that oversight will fizzle to a burnt ember,\" he said. \"We’ve got to keep the fire going now.”","author":"KYLE CHENEY","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T09:07:05.000Z"},"source":{"id":"politico","name":"Politico"},"urlToImage":"https://static.politico.com/76/1f/596598ba49e7b2203ab4a6368ce5/180504-desantis-jordan-ap-1160.jpg","digest":"O+Lkj3KarbB45otNCg4t6Q==\n"}

Bo was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 for corruption.\n\nOther high-profile figures to fall in Xi’s campaign include, Zhou Yongkang, a retired member of the party’s all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee; and Guo Boxiong, a former top general. Both are serving life prison terms after being convicted of corruption or other misconduct.","author":"Christopher Bodeen / AP","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T06:16:08.000Z"},"source":{"id":"time","name":"Time"},"urlToImage":"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-648606150.jpg?quality=85","digest":"5QYP8G147bHkb6O8HRH6zw==\n"}

Chinese officials probably were taken aback by the sheer breadth of requests.\n\nOne could argue that Trump asked for too much, or that his agenda is unfocused. A less confrontational approach might work better, with Beijing touchy about foreign pressure. And a couple of items do seem unreasonable, particularly the misguided edict for a $200 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nStill, China should do what Trump says. Not to appease Washington, but for its own good. Most of the changes the U.S. is seeking would help Beijing’s leaders achieve their economic goals.\n\nMany of the demands clear away principles that are out of touch, both with international practice and the needs of today’s China. By implementing them, the nation could boost productivity, increase innovation and better allocate resources.\n\nTake Trump’s insistence on stronger protection of intellectual property.\n\nThe joint-venture and other rules forcing multinationals to disgorge technology to gain market access in China can make CEOs wary of importing their best know-how. Stronger IP protection would encourage international – and Chinese – businesses to invest in R\u0026D.\n\nDropping tariffs and other barriers has benefits, too. More open access for products and services would increase competition and consumer choice, giving momentum to Beijing’s push toward a consumption-driven growth model. Ending or reducing financial support to companies in favored sectors, like those in the “Made in China 2025” industrial program, would help avoid the kind of excess created by earlier efforts in, for example, steel. There’s ample evidence that picking winners and plying them with cheap credit seldom produces competitive companies. The Japanese tried it and achieved little: Most of that nation’s success stories were never targeted for bureaucratic support.\n\nTreating foreign firms equally will ensure something else that’s crucial for China – full access for its own companies to the U.S. and other markets.\n\nThe imbalance in the relationship can be seen in the very different demands brought to the negotiating table. Beijing  trotted out more narrowly defined requests, some of them related to recent actions by the Trump administration. That’s because Chinese firms have enjoyed relatively free access to the U.S. market, both as investors and exporters (with a few exceptions, like Huawei Technologies Co.) That situation won’t last. If Beijing doesn’t open its doors, Chinese companies will find life increasingly hard, undercutting their ability to become global. Trump is also threatening to sever access to U.S. technology – a potentially serious blow.\n\nTo be fair, China is  undertaking some of these reforms, such as a phased elimination of joint-venture requirements in car manufacturing. My guess is it will try to avoid many of the rest, especially on a time scale acceptable to Washington. Beijing perceives its industrial policies as essential, and won’t significantly scale them back. The state press has been railing that the government doesn’t force foreign firms to transfer technology, a sure sign of the official stance.\n\nFundamentally, China’s leaders don’t see pro-market practices or fair trade treatment as necessary. The nation is on a quest to promote corporate champions and technological development through state-led industrial policies. Don’t expect that to change soon: The current administration isn’t willing to trust markets to develop the nation. Indeed, the Communist Party is entrenching itself more deeply in the corporate ethos.\n\nSo the talks in Beijing weren’t just about trade and market access. The conflict is morphing into something bigger – call it a clash of economic civilizations. The U.S., very generally, believes openness wins, accepted norms and rules are critical in economic relations and private enterprise is better at creating jobs and technological breakthroughs than government. China believes in controlling markets to achieve goals, in the indispensable role of the state and in altering rules as the need arises.\n\nWith such a chasm between the sides, last week’s negotiations were doomed. Future rounds may face a similar fate.","author":"Michael Schuman","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T05:08:55.000Z"},"source":{"id":"bloomberg","name":"Bloomberg"},"urlToImage":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ik1O8nW5yoA8/v1/1200x800.jpg","digest":"6T2xl5ptsy2MntdexSf8Pw==\n"}

Does he follow his instincts and honor a campaign promise to his loyal political base? Or does he risk dealing a severe rebuke to US allies who back the deal by re-imposing US sanctions on Iran?\n\nAlternatively, he could claim the headline of refusing to continue waiving sanctions against Iran, but stop short of imposing new punishments immediately. That could keep open a narrow window for America's European allies to continue trying to broker a broader deal that could keep Trump on board.\n\nGiven that Trump's gut usually wins out over his concern for America's friends or complicated calculations of geopolitical ramifications down the road, it's no surprise most people think he will pull out of the deal.\n\n\"It's pretty obvious to me that unless something changes in the next few days, I believe the President will not waive the sanctions,\" CNN's Jim Sciutto quoted a European diplomat as saying.\n\n\"And that will have various consequences that I think we have yet to fully to understand and spell out.\"\n\nLeaving the deal would represent another sharp turn away from the multilateral diplomacy that underpinned Obama's foreign policy and America's approach to the world for much of the 20th Century.\n\nIt would also introduce an illogical note into Trump's own diplomatic strategy, since he would be withdrawing from one nuclear deal with a US enemy, while trying to negotiate another, with North Korea.\n\nYet Trump, who last month called the deal \"insane\" and \"ridiculous\" is notoriously unpredictable. He could still spring a surprise.\n\nSo all eyes in Washington, Tehran, Beijing, Moscow and EU capitals will be focused on the White House at 2 p.m. ET when he will stand in the global spotlight -- where he loves to be -- to make his announcement.\n\n\"The United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nIf Trump does decide to pull out of the Iran agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it will be because he thinks it's the \"worst deal in history.\"\n\nThe President has frequently misrepresented the terms of the deal that froze Iran's nuclear program and complained that it does not halt Tehran's missile tests or power moves in the Middle East.\n\nHe repeatedly brings up the billions of dollars in unfrozen Iranian assets and funds held in escrow that were returned to the Islamic Republic after the deal was agreed in 2015.\n\nObama's reasoning was that the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon was so dangerous that a deal to stop Tehran short of a weapons threshold was the most urgent priority.\n\nDeal supporters say that the pact has stretched the \"break out\" time Iran would need to race to a bomb to at least a year, has mothballed most of its centrifuges and all but eradicated its uranium stockpile.\n\nBut critics say the deal includes sunset clauses that will eventually allow Iran to resume the production of highly enriched uranium that could be used for weapons.\n\nThe President promised to kill the deal on the campaign trail but allowed himself to be persuaded by cabinet members and allies several times to recertify Iran's compliance, to his evident fury.\n\nBut now, with a new foreign policy team including national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who also oppose the deal, the President may have a freer hand.\n\nStill, some Republicans in the national security establishment argue that the consequences of leaving could be worse than staying in.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis last month told the Senate Armed Services committee that the verification provisions in the pact were \"pretty robust\" though he did not publicly back the deal.\n\nDespite his criticism of the deal, neither Trump nor his aides have been able to say that Iran is infringing the agreement.\n\nAnd there has been no detailed explanation from the administration about what happens next if the US tears it up.\n\nPulling out of the JCPOA would risk a serious split with leaders of America's traditional European allies, who have trekked to Washington in recent weeks to flatter, cajole and warn Trump.\n\n'Walking away with no Plan B\n\nWestern diplomats have been trying for months to get Trump to stay in the deal or to negotiate measures on missiles and constraining Iran's geopolitical push that could stand alongside the Iran deal.\n\nBut privately, foreign diplomats have confided that the biggest problem with the agreement is the visceral distaste the President harbors towards anything that his predecessor achieved.\n\nThat's one reason why some observers believe that the decision on the Iran agreement is more dictated by politics than statesmanship.\n\n\"This agreement is highly flawed but it is functional,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace negotiator for Democratic and Republican presidents, this month on CNN.\n\n\"Walking away from it without a Plan B I think is a political interest of the President but it is not in the national interest.\"\n\nIran has said there can be no renegotiation of the nuclear deal, a position shared by Russia and China, two other signatories.\n\nIf Trump does decide to pull out of the deal, his speech will be closely watched for details that could dictate what happens next.\n\nHe could simply say that the US does not intend to comply any longer and reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted in 2015. If he does not impose sanctions immediately, that could leave a small window for European allies to continue seeking a compromise.\n\nIf Trump does slap sanctions back on Iran right away, it could give European states an unpalatable dilemma -- do they follow suit or refuse in a move that could split the transatlantic alliance wide open?\n\nTrump's move will also pose choices for Iran.\n\nWith its hobbled economy, Tehran could announce it is sticking with the deal in the hope of accruing the benefits of expanded trade with European firms -- and hope to split the US and Europe.\n\nOr it could make a more aggressive move and start to enrich nuclear fuel again, a step that could force European states to reimpose their own sanctions and could precipitate a major international crisis.","author":"Stephen Collinson, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T05:05:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180424101419-trump-iran-sanctions-super-tease.jpg","digest":"JML5p9udTD6HnfekJ1j5xQ==\n"}

How is the character accessible?\" Joe said. \"I have a hard time with comic book characters, I did as a child, that were too powerful because I never feared for them, I never felt like I could relate to them.

It's a concern shared by Trump allies who think Giuliani is only generating more legal and political trouble for the White House.\n\nGiuliani, the newest addition to the president's legal team, first rattled the White House last week when he sat for interviews on Fox News and seemed to contradict Trump by saying the president was aware of the $130,000 payout to Daniels from his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. He also suggested the October 2016 settlement had been made because Trump was in the stretch run of his presidential campaign.\n\nAfter Trump chided Giuliani on Friday, saying the lawyer needed to \"get his facts straight,\" Giuliani put out a statement trying to clarify his remarks. But in weekend interviews, Giuliani appeared to dig himself a deeper hole by acknowledging that \"Cohen takes care of situations like this, then gets paid for them sometimes.\" He did not rule out the possibility that Cohen had paid off other women.\n\nTrump, who has denied the affair with Daniels, was angry that Giuliani had given the impression that other women may have made similar charges of infidelity, according to the people familiar with his views.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has grown agitated in recent days by replays of Giuliani's interview with Sean Hannity, in which he said that Trump knew about the payment but that it wasn't a campaign violation. A clearly surprised Hannity then asked, \"Because they funneled it through the law firm?\"\n\nTo which Giuliani responded, \"Funneled it through the law firm, and the president repaid him.\"\n\nTrump snapped at both men in recent days, chiding Hannity for using the word \"funneled,\" which he believes had illegal connotations, according to the people who spoke to The Associated Press. As for Giuliani, the president has not yet signaled to him to stop appearing on television but told a confidant recently that perhaps Giuliani should \"be benched\" — at least temporarily — if he can't improve his performance.\n\nThe president has not publicly discussed dismissing Giuliani and has appreciated his sharp attacks on the Russia investigation and his forceful battles with the press, according to three White House aides and outside allies. The two men have spoken frequently, according to officials familiar with their interactions but not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nBut many Trump allies both inside and outside the White House have grown anxious in recent days about Giuliani's whirlwind and unpredictable interviews.\n\n\"They're admitting to enough that warrants scrutiny. It shouldn't be put on television shows off the cuff,\" said Alan Dershowitz, the emeritus Harvard law professor who has been informally advising Trump on the Russia collusion probe. \"This is not the way to handle a complicated case.\"\n\nMany in the White House have begun evoking comparisons between Giuliani and Anthony Scaramucci, another hard-charging New Yorker with a knack for getting TV airtime.\n\nScaramucci lasted 11 days before being fired. The former White House communications director himself drew parallels between his own burn-bright-burn-fast tenure and Giuliani's performance.\n\n\"I am enjoying all of the comparisons between me and the mayor #RudyGiuliani,\" Scaramucci tweeted Sunday. \"He is loyal, tough and a fierce competitor. He fights and will win for @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. Big compliment thank you!\"\n\nGiuliani did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWest Wing aides were blindsided by Giuliani's TV appearances last week, and many senior advisers and members of the president's legal team have been cut out of the decision-making process. But some aides have been reluctant to broach the subject with Trump because it only increases their liability, according to officials.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was among those surprised by Giuliani's string of TV appearances, said Monday that Trump felt the former mayor \"added value\" to his outside legal team. On Friday, Trump said Giuliani was \"a great guy but he just started a day ago.\" He made clear Giuliani was still \"learning the subject matter.\"\n\nSome West Wing aides have complained that Giuliani, who ran for president in 2008, was acting like a \"principal\" and not a member of a team. And some in Trump's inner circle raised their eyebrows at Giuliani's declaration that Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, was \"disposable.\" He also declined to rule out Trump invoking the Fifth Amendment in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia probe.\n\nThe episode revived worries in Trump's inner circle about Giuliani, who enjoys the media limelight and has a tendency to go off-script. His behavior grew more unpredictable during the stretch run of the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump chided him for falling asleep on the campaign plane, according to two former campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\nGiuliani also alienated a number of people in Trump's inner circle by insisting that the only Cabinet position he would consider would be secretary of state. He did not get the post.\n\nGiuliani's remarks have also been watched with concern at the State Department and Pentagon after he weighed in recently on international affairs. He declared last week that North Korea would be releasing three Americans being held captive, which has not yet happened, and said the administration was committed to regime change in Iran, a stance Trump has not taken.","author":"Jonathan Lemire","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T04:46:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Chicagotribune.com"},"urlToImage":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-5af0efd3/turbine/ct-trump-giuliani-frustration-20180507","digest":"ZaIF53Mxd2oTF9+ZRyK6BQ==\n"}

Kim said during that meeting he was “ready to have a dialogue with Japan anytime”, Moon told the newspaper.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Japanese government, which has called Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile programmes the toughest security threat facing Japan since World War Two.\n\nMoon’s interview was conducted ahead of a summit on Wednesday between Moon, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Tokyo.\n\nNorth Korea was expected to be high on the agenda but a Chinese diplomat said last week the talks were about regional cooperation and not focussed on the Korean peninsula\n\nNevertheless, months of frosty relations between Beijing and Pyongyang appear to have thawed since Kim’s secretive visit to Beijing in March, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nAnalysts said Kim’s meeting with Xi strengthened North Korea’s negotiating position by aligning the two nations ahead of Kim’s summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming weeks.\n\nA high-ranking North Korean official visited the Chinese city of Dalian this week, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Tuesday, citing multiple anonymous sources.\n\nThe North Korean official flew in a private plane and arrived at Dalian airport on Monday amid heavy security, Yonhap said.

Eventually, the church lent more than 40 items to the exhibition, which encompasses an enormous 58,600 square feet and extends to the Cloisters. A papal tiara, with 18,000 diamonds, was flown to New York with a bodyguard.\n\nThe Met Gala may be the world’s fanciest party. The ceremonial red carpet procession was to be followed by cocktails, then dinner (lobster with gold flakes was on the menu), then a dessert buffet. President Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, there in 2004. Tickets are $30,000, but you can’t just buy one — Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Condé Nast who is one of the chairwomen, approves attendees.\n\nAnd its red carpet entrance is one of the premier showcases of celebrity brands, for musicians, actors and fashion folks alike.\n\n“This carpet is one of the most important carpets of the year,” the model Bella Hadid said.\n\nA staff member dipped to adjust the train of the designer Ariana Rockefeller, David Rockefeller Jr.’s daughter.\n\n“We based the dress on a tapestry from the Cloisters museum,” Ms. Rockefeller said. “And of course my great-grandfather John D. Rockefeller Jr. founded the museum, so we really wanted to incorporate family history as well as honor the theme tonight.”\n\nUnlike in the Crusades themselves, there was very little blood shed this evening. “They had to sew me in on the way here,” said Olivia Munn, who was bleeding very slightly. Her dress was inspired by Crusade-era chain mail, by H\u0026M.\n\n“It’s sewn into my head,” Ms. Hadid said of her veil. She was wearing Chrome Hearts. “The things we do, darling.”\n\nAnd, in what has become something of a tradition, one attendee used the night to seize attention.\n\nWhile all these celebrities flirted with the theme of Catholicism this year, none took it on as fearlessly as Rihanna, a chairwoman for the event who dressed like the female pope the Vatican has never had.\n\nRihanna’s hat was reminiscent of the papal tiaras worn by popes from the medieval era until the mid-1960s.\n\nOthers were ready to take the evening less seriously.\n\nFavorite part of the night? “Eating a vegan cheeseburger right before,” said the poet Cleo Wade.\n\nEva Chen wore an outfit inspired by Joan of Arc and said the bathroom was the place to be. “The secret is that is where people are partying,’’ she said. “No, I’m joking.”\n\nWhere were his kids, George Clooney was asked? “They’re under the dress,” he said, waving toward the enormous train on the outfit worn by his wife, Amal, one of the event’s chairwomen.\n\n“I forgot my ticket, do you think they’ll let me in?” asked the performer Rita Ora as she approached the entrance to the Met. They might, if they know who you are!\n\nBut a feeling of religiosity did suffuse the evening.\n\nKaty Perry arrived in enormous white feathered wings. “I feel very angelic, celestial, ethereal,” Ms. Perry said on the red carpet.\n\n“Yeah, I love God,” said the comedian Tiffany Haddish. “God love me — look at my career.”\n\nThe event is underwritten by Christine and Stephen A. Schwarzman, and by Versace. In addition to Rihanna, Ms. Wintour and Ms. Clooney, Donatella Versace is also a chairwoman.\n\nMs. Wintour has led the gala since 1999. The event, said Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, “has gotten better and better each year.”","author":"Jonah Engel Bromwich and Valeriya Safronova","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T02:16:17.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/fashion/red-carpet-met-gala-2082-rihanna/red-carpet-met-gala-2082-rihanna-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","digest":"zqqJWDUNd+RJ7snMYmg6cQ==\n"}

Joe Manchin that the Democratic incumbent might win.","title":"GOP leader: 'Let's hope and pray' Blankenship doesn't win West Virginia primary","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/07/politics/republican-senators-reaction-don-blankenship-primary/index.html","text":"\"Let's hope and pray that doesn't happen,\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking GOP leader.\n\nGOP concerns about the contentious candidate winning are so great they were discussed Monday at a private meeting of top Republican leaders in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Capitol office, Thune said.\n\n\"We are starting to think through the various scenarios,\" Thune said. \"It would not be good.\"\n\nAn administration official said the White House is becoming concerned that Blankenship could become \"Roy Moore on steroids\" if he wins the primary. The official said there is a worry that the other candidates in the race will split the establishment vote, giving Blankenship the opportunity to capture the nomination.\n\nBut Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking GOP leader, was asked about President Donald Trump's decision to tweet his desire that West Virginia voters choose from the other candidates in the primary because they would have a better chance of unseating Manchin and flipping the seat to the GOP. \"That's his choice,\" Cornyn said of the President's tweet. \"I just hope they pick the best nominee so we can pick the seat up in November.\" RELATED: The ex-con who called McConnell 'cocaine Mitch' could actually become West Virginia's GOP Senate nominee Cornyn added that he didn't think West Virginia voters were interested in his opinion or that of anyone else outside the state. \"I'm happy to let them make that decision,\" Cornyn said. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which oversees electing Republicans senators, agreed that leaders in Washington should let West Virginia voters decide. \"The last thing the people of West Virginia want is the people of Washington telling them what to do,\" Gardner said. Republicans hold a 51- to 49-seat advantage in the Senate going into a midterm election where Democrats must defend far more seats than Republicans. Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said that if Blankenship wins the primary Flake will support Manchin and donate money to him. Flake said GOP support for Moore, a failed Alabama Senate candidate, had caused broad problems for the party, especially with suburban female voters. \"When they saw the President and other officials -- the RNC -- backing someone like Roy Moore, too many people are saying, 'That's not my party,' \" Flake said. Marc Short, who directs legislative affairs for the White House, predicted Blankenship would not win. \"It would obviously create a big challenge but that's not what we expect is going to happen,\" Short said. Manchin declined to say if he would prefer to face Blankenship, saying Blankenship would be hard to beat. \"He's working it hard. He's putting his money where his mouth is,\" Manchin told CNN. Asked if he believed Blankenship would be a tough opponent, Manchin said, \"Anybody would be tough.

The private investigator also gave Zimmerman Gasparro’s number, and Zimmerman called Gasparro shortly after. According to court documents, they chatted about the documentary, which will be about Martin’s life and death, for which Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. On July 13, 2013, Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury.\n\nOutside of the initial text and voice mail, the private investigator made no further attempts to speak or meet with Zimmerman, deputies wrote in a warrant request.\n\n[George Zimmerman’s many, many controversies since the Trayvon Martin case]\n\nThen, on Dec. 13, the private investigator heard from Zimmerman. Gasparro called the private investigator to tell him that Zimmerman was “extremely agitated” and sending Gasparro threatening messages, according to the warrant request.\n\nThe private investigator “is a [expletive] WHO BOTHERED MY UNCLE IN HIS HOME. Local OR former law officer He’s well on his way to the inside of a gator as well. 10-4?” Zimmerman wrote to Gasparro, according to the warrant request.\n\nA few days later, Zimmerman began contacting the private investigator directly. About 21 phone calls, 38 text messages and seven voice mails were sent to him in just over a 2 1/2-hour period. Threats included expletives and statements such as, “I’ll see you before you realize it,” according to the warrant request. The private investigator, concerned about his safety and that of his family, contacted the sheriff’s office.\n\nA deputy wrote in the warrant request that he advised the private investigator to send Zimmerman a single text message, asking him to stop contacting him — and that if he didn’t, the private investigator would involve law enforcement officials.\n\nThe private investigator sent the message, to which Zimmerman responded “No!” and “Pursue charges,” according to the warrant request. “Text me again, I’ll show up at your home you [expletive]!!!”\n\nThe private investigator also told deputies that Zimmerman sent him a link to a news article on TheBlast.com in which he was quoted as saying, “I know how to handle people who f— with me, I have since February of 2012.” The comment was a reference to Martin’s killing.\n\nThe article also quotes Zimmerman as saying “Anyone who f***s with my parents will be fed to an alligator.” It wasn’t Zimmerman’s first alligator-related threat toward someone involved with the documentary: He made a similar threat to Jay-Z himself.\n\n“What I said is I would beat him as if I was Solange, and he would find himself coming out of the south side of a gator if he comes to Florida and bothers my family,” Zimmerman told the Orlando Sentinel in December. He was referencing how Solange Knowles, the sister of Beyoncé — who is married to Jay-Z — was captured in an elevator surveillance video hitting Jay-Z after the 2014 Met Gala.\n\nBetween Dec. 16, 2017, and Christmas Day, the private investigator received 55 phone calls, 67 text messages, 36 voice mails and 27 emails from Zimmerman, according to the warrant request. This led sheriff’s Sgt. Shannon Seiple — who had met Zimmerman before — to give him a call on Jan. 3, to confirm that the calls and messages were coming from him.\n\nZimmerman answered, asking “Who is this?” according to the warrant request. Seiple identified herself, to which Zimmerman responded, “You [expletive], what do you want!” and “What are you calling me for you [expletive]!” according to the warrant request. Seiple explained that she was calling in reference to Zimmerman’s calls to the private investigator. Zimmerman “continued to scream profanity,” according to the warrant request.\n\n“You are the [expletive] blond [expletive] who arrested me on Samantha!” Zimmerman allegedly told Seiple. “You have been involved with me since that Martin kid!”\n\nThe sheriff’s deputies confirmed that it was Zimmerman who was on the phone and requested that he be charged, according to court documents.\n\nSince his 2013 acquittal, Zimmerman has been embroiled in public controversies. One example came in October 2015, when he retweeted a photograph of Trayvon Martin’s slain body. The original tweet read “Z-man is a one-man army.” Following media outrage, Zimmerman claimed that he wasn’t aware the tweet included a photograph, according to The Washington Post’s Travis M. Andrews.","author":null,"publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T00:29:27.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jF55Bi7try9FV3FbnI-BbsUGS-U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WPT2DGAHDU4RTEV3X456UA36GQ.jpg","digest":"wh6srm4wXGtySJNaAdB+AQ==\n"}

His joke was to merge this thought experiment with a pun using “Rococo,” referring to the ornate French 18th century baroque style, perhaps pointing out that both concepts are complex, too extreme and ridiculous.\n\nAnd while this takes some explaining, arty performer Grimes was already in on the same joke — three years ahead of Musk.\n\nIn 2015, she created a character named “Rococo Basilisk” for a video of her song “Flesh Without Blood.” “I don’t know if you’ve heard of Roko’s Basilisk,” she told Fuse. “[This character] is doomed to be eternally tortured by an artificial intelligence, but she’s also kind of like Marie Antoinette.”\n\n“Elon was researching the idea of joking about Rococo Basilisk, and when he saw Grimes had already joked about it, he reached out to her,” says the insider. “Grimes said this was the first time in three years that anyone understood the joke. They were both poking fun at AI.”\n\nMusk is well known for warning of an AI apocalypse, calling it “more dangerous than nukes.”\n\nSpaceX and Tesla founder Musk has been very public in his past fandom for Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. He tweeted out her artsy video with Janelle Monae for the song “Venus Fly” this past March, adding “Best music video art I’ve seen in a while.”\n\nGrimes shot to fame in 2012 with her third studio album, “Visions,” and also put out the critically acclaimed “Art Angels” in 2015. She recently revealed she has clashed with her label 4AD, saying “There’s some srsly f–ked up and crazy s–t going behind the scenes in my career,” but that she will be releasing another album with 4AD, followed by independent music. “I just took a month off, a lot of insane s–t went down and I’m reorienting my life,” she wrote on Instagram. “I have a deep well of s–t this time, like sooo many songs so after my album I’ll be able to consistently release new music.”\n\nShe was a double major in psychology and philosophy, with minors in Russian and electro-acoustics before she dropped out of school to follow her music career.\n\nThe tech billionaire also tweeted his approval of her Spotify playlist “Go Flex \u0026 Psycho.” “Glad ur finally listening to cyberpunk speedwae hahaha,” she responded. “Sounds great riding my cyborg,” he hit back.\n\nJust last week they had another online in-joke. After Musk tweeted a video created from long-exposure photos of a comet, Grimes said “that’s a lot of cocaine,” to which he responded, “Yeah, most people don’t know this, but comets [are] mostly made of cocaine.”\n\nAside from flaunting their banter online, Musk hinted at his talented Met Gala date on Monday, tweeting “Rococo basilisk,” and a link to the Rococo Wikipedia page.","author":"Emily Smith, Mara Siegler","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T21:59:46.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Pagesix.com"},"urlToImage":"https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/grimes-elon-musk.jpg?quality=90\u0026strip=all\u0026w=1200","digest":"TFbyd9Aoe4cxTGPhSs41NQ==\n"}

He provides several examples…","title":"Are we in the AI revolution? Microsoft's keynote points to huge change","url":"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/microsoft-build-2018-keynote-ai-revolution/","text":"Microsoft’s annual Build conference for developers kicked off the week starting with a keynote provided by CEO Satya Nadella. He didn’t reveal any new Windows 10 hardware, but instead focused his presentation on solutions spanning from the intelligent cloud to the intelligent edge, the latter of which simply classifies everything we use ranging from smart thermostats to HoloLens in the corporate environment.\n\nHe began the keynote emphasizing how artificial intelligence is changing the world, drawing parallels to the Industrial Revolution where, in a span of 20 years, the nation moved from horse-drawn engines to automobiles. The core technologies of the Industrial Revolution were essentially invisible: the combustion engines in cars, plumbing in buildings, the installment on electrical systems for lighting, and so on. Artificial intelligence and the cloud are just as revolutionary and invisible.\n\nOne example is Microsoft’s new partnership with civilian drone manufacturer DJI. Commercial drones will feature an integrated Azure IoT Edge component, enabling customers to deploy an artificial intelligence model developed in the cloud right to the drone itself in real time. Even more, that A.I. model can be deployed across the corporation’s drone army scattered across the globe in mere minutes.\n\nIn an on-stage demo, Azure Internet of Things director Sam George showcased an Azure IoT Edge-based smart camera produced by Qualcomm that detected a stress fracture stemming from a tank within a facility. A second camera discovered a pressure drop on the roof. That is where DJI’s drone comes in: Instead of sending a technician on a long, dangerous journey up to the roof, a company can simply send a smart drone to investigate and correctly identify the problem. Moreover, the drone can use the same A.I. model downloaded to Qualcomm’s camera. This advancement can save both time and money while keeping workers safe.\n\nWhile that may sound like ho-hum news to the mainstream customer, Nadella eventually shifted his presentation to Cortana, Microsoft’s digital assistant for Windows 10. He said that Microsoft wants customers to get the most out of their devices and assistants, and not be bound by a single walled garden. In turn, the company wants developers to have access to the maximum amount of end users. With that, Nadella talked about Microsoft’s collaboration with Amazon to pair Cortana with Alexa.\n\nTo demonstrate the possibilities, Tom Taylor from the Alexa team and Cortana general manager Megan Saunders took to the stage. Saunders first told Alexa to add milk to her shopping list using Amazon’s Echo speaker, and then told Alexa to open Cortana. After that, Cortana took control of the device, allowing Saunders to check her calendar, and verbally send an email via Outlook to Taylor.\n\nIn turn, Taylor received the email on his Windows 10 PC, asked Cortana about the location of the dinner date, and then told Cortana to open Alexa. Amazon’s assistant then took control of Cortana’s space, allowing him to verbally schedule an Uber ride and turn off all Alexa-controlled lights. He even asked Alexa what she thought about her new friend, Cortana.\n\n“I like Cortana. We both have experience with light rings, although hers is more of a halo,” Alexa said. Rimshot, please.\n\nAnother mainstream-friendly portion of Nadella’s keynote appeared in ways the company’s technology streamlines business meetings. It was called the Your Phone app for Android and an upcoming version of Windows 10. Instead of opening and unlocking your phone more than 100 times per day, you can simply see and reply to your phone’s notifications, messages, and photos within the Windows 10 PC app. Consider it as an upgrade to the current method of manually replying to messages through Cortana.\n\nFor instance, you can drag an image located anywhere on your Windows 10 PC and drop it into an SMS message within the app. If the recipient responds with an image, you can drag and drop the picture into PowerPoint and other programs installed on your PC. For phone notifications, you can open the equivalent Windows 10 app or view them on the internet.\n\nOutside the Your Phone app, this portion of the keynote focused on using Teams, Office 365, and intelligent devices in the meeting. For instance, the smart device seated on the conference table recognized and bid good morning to all who entered the office space. The device also recognized who was speaking and rendered their spoken words within Teams. This eliminated the need for taking notes and provided a full transcript at the end.\n\nAt the end of his keynote, Nadella said Microsoft wants to empower more people and organizations. The technology needs to reach everyone, thus Microsoft introduced A.I. for Accessibility. It’s a grant program for developers, engineers, and more to create intelligent solutions for individuals with disabilities. A video showcased several A.I.-powered technologies that improve the lives of these individuals such as Soundscape, eye-controlled interfaces, Swiftkey symbols, and the learning tools just introduced in Windows 10 April 2018 Update.\n\nFinally, Microsoft briefly revealed the public preview of its new Azure Blockchain Workbench. This platform allows developers to create applications that rely on an Azure-supported blockchain. This blockchain can be linked to Active Directory for easier collaboration and logins. Developers can also use Azure Key Vault to store keys and synchronize data between on-chain and off-chain storage and databases. Workbench even supports Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps.","author":"Kevin Parrish","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T20:31:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Digitaltrends.com"},"urlToImage":"https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/build-2018-keynote-1-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg","digest":"ihUDqjHNxgvk2+b+TUdXeg==\n"}

On at least one campus, classes were delayed.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., announced that she wouldn’t deliver her scheduled commencement speech at UC Berkeley this weekend because of the labor dispute, university officials said.\n\nThe biggest disruption was at medical centers, where health care workers were among participants in the protest. Thousands of appointments had to be postponed at UCSF’s Mission Bay and Parnassus Avenue campuses.\n\nWhile university administrators were planning to bring in at least 1,000 replacement employees, sympathy strikes set for Tuesday by the California Nurses Union and the University Professional and Technical Employees were expected to complicate matters. In total, the number of striking employees could reach 53,000.\n\n“Our only option again is to strike,” said Kathryn Lybarger, president of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, whose 25,000 systemwide workers initiated the action. “We are holding the line on some of the last middle-class jobs in California.”\n\nThe AFSCME members represent over 15,000 vocational nurses, respiratory therapists and medical technologists across the UC system as well as more than 9,000 janitors, cooks and security guards.\n\nAt the Parnassus Avenue campus in San Francisco’s Sunset District, the union members chanted, “Who has the power? We got the power!” as they marched outside the hospital’s emergency room. They wore green shirts bearing their union’s name and waved green inflatable batons as passing motorists honked in support.\n\nUniversity officials said more than 300 surgeries and 800 cancer patient appointments had been postponed, and all elective procedures were put on hold at the two San Francisco campuses. Emergency medical services remained open, and patients arriving at clinics didn’t report disruptions.\n\n“Today my concern is mostly around patient care,” said Sheila Antrum, senior vice president and chief operating officer of UCSF. “I’m just going to keep on that track and stay focused.”\n\nOfficials at UC Davis Medical Center said they rescheduled appointments for 769 patients, including more than 100 cancer examinations and 150 radiology exams.\n\nAt UC Santa Cruz, morning classes were canceled until noon because demonstrators were blocking two campus entrances, said Scott Hernandez-Jason, a university spokesman. Afternoon classes were expected to resume.\n\nBoth UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley officials said shuttle services were not running during the strike. Instead, city buses, like AC Transit in Berkeley, were providing student transportation.\n\n“So far things seem to be fine. (But) we are in the first few hours of the first day,” said UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore.\n\nIn Los Angeles, workers had an unexpected scare Monday morning when a man drove into a crowd of picketers near UCLA. Three university employees were treated for minor injuries. The driver was taken into custody, UCLA police said.\n\nAFSCME and university administrators remained at a standstill in contract negotiations. The union rejected the university’s offer of 3 percent annual raises over four years, insisting on pay increases of 6 percent a year.\n\nThe employees have also demanded that their health care costs remain flat, their jobs not be contracted to nonunion workers and their retirement age, for pension eligibility, not rise.\n\nUniversity officials say state taxpayers should not be stuck with the bill for better compensation, especially when employees make as much or more than those working similar jobs. Union representatives say they deserve more.\n\n“They’ve been tone deaf to our calls around inequality and stopping the outsourcing,” Lybarger said. “They won’t even say the words inequality and outsourcing.”\n\nShe said strikes have been an effective strategy in the past, giving rise to further negotiations and eventually a good deal.\n\n“Striking is a last resort that we’ve been pushed to time and again,” Lybarger said.\n\nAnton Goff, 48, of Hercules, and Andrew Fisher, 58, of Pinole, stood silently across the street from the picket line. In their green protest shirts, they stared as people chanted and yelled while they sipped their tea and coffee and clutched a sign reading “AFSCME 3299 On Strike Secure Future For All.”\n\nThe two men are UCSF custodians, Goff for 13 years, and Fisher for 11 years. They said their last raise was nearly four years ago, despite repeated requests for more. They make about $23 an hour.\n\n“We’re just talking a few percent on our salary. It’s just ridiculous,” Fisher said. “It’s difficult. They take care of their doctors. They’re not taking care of the real people.”\n\nFisher said he has put three kids through college while working at UCSF but had to work construction, landscaping and carpentry jobs on the side.","author":"Sarah Ravani","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-07T18:43:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":null,"name":"Sfgate.com"},"urlToImage":"https://s.hdnux.com/photos/73/14/04/15515933/5/rawImage.jpg","digest":"9VTU7shgR4Uot9++Loqchw==\n"}

David Marcus, the executive in charge of Facebook’s standalone messaging app, Messenger, is leaving that post to run the blockchain group, these sources said. That new team will fall under one of the other three divisions, referred to as “New platforms and infra,” which will be managed by CTO Mike Schroepfer. Facebook’s AR, VR and artificial intelligence efforts will also live under Schroepfer’s division.\n\nLongtime Facebook exec Javier Olivan, the company’s VP of growth, will oversee the third division, called “Central product services,” which includes all of the shared features that operate across multiple products or apps such as ads, security and growth.\n\nSurprisingly, no one appears to be leaving Facebook. Just a lot of old faces in new places.\n\nYou may have noticed from the diagram that almost all of Facebook’s top product and engineering execs are men. That’s true, though Facebook does have a number of high ranking and influential female product executives that aren’t directly involved in these changes. For example: Fidji Simo, who runs video; Deb Liu, who runs Marketplace; and Julie Zhuo, who runs design. Then, of course, there’s Sheryl Sandberg on the business side of things.\n\nThe changes all come at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg, who has been openly discussing his need to take more responsibility for Facebook’s impact on the world. Zuckerberg’s New Year’s resolution was to fix Facebook, and restructuring the team is clearly part of that fix. The hope is that these new roles will keep more open lines of communication among executives without hurting the speed Facebook is known for. (“Move fast and break things,” remember?)\n\nThe new product and engineering orgs have been divided into three key groups.\n\nThis is the group Cox will oversee, which includes WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and the core Facebook app. Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom will continue to run Instagram, but the other three apps are getting new leaders:\n\nHaving all four product leaders roll up to Cox is meant to improve communication among the products. Previously, the leaders of all of these teams had different bosses. Koum rolled up to Zuckerberg, Systrom rolled up to Schroepfer and Marcus reported to Olivan. As Facebook increasingly builds more features that live inside all of the apps (e.g. Stories), it makes sense to have their leaders working closer together.\n\nThis group will be under the direction of Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s CTO. As you can probably guess from the name, this group will incorporate all of Facebook’s longterm product and business efforts, like virtual reality, augmented reality and the newly formed blockchain group.\n\nAll of the other product and engineering functions — ads, security, growth — will fall to another longtime Facebooker, Javier Olivan, who has been with the company more than a decade. Olivan has run Facebook’s growth team for years and is credited for helping Facebook achieve the massive scale it’s now known for. Olivan will also oversee a lot of important parts of the Facebook business.\n\nHere are a few more changes taking place at Facebook this week.\n\nAdam Mosseri, the Facebook product executive who runs News Feed, is headed over to Instagram to become the company’s new VP of product. In his old job, Mosseri was tasked with building and then explaining Facebook’s ever-changing News Feed algorithm to journalists and media companies, and he became a savvy Twitter user in the process. The company didn’t share specifics about his new role, but it seems fair to assume his experience running one feed at Facebook will help running another feed at Instagram.\n\nYou might now be thinking: What about Instagram’s existing VP of product, Kevin Weil? Good question. Weil is leaving Instagram and headed over to Facebook’s newly formed blockchain team, the one that David Marcus is running. So a few new places for a couple of familiar faces.\n\nFacebook is shuffling the top of its communication team, too. Caryn Marooney, who has been running the day-to-day operations for all Facebook communications over the past two years, is handing over some of her responsibilities to PR veteran Rachel Whetstone, who joined Facebook last summer. Marooney will handle product communications and Whetstone is taking over corporate comms.\n\nWhetstone is very well known in Silicon Valley. She joined Facebook after running communications and policy at Uber during the company’s Travis Kalanick-inflicted PR nightmare. Before that, she worked at Google for 10 years also running communications and policy. She’s climbed up Facebook’s internal ranks very quickly and is already an influential voice in the room when it comes to policy decisions, sources say.","author":"Kurt Wagner","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T19:56:49.000Z"},"source":{"id":"recode","name":"Recode"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzLmEPdBc8mrJut1wOgkxO72qVE=/0x63:2048x1135/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10798355/18451354_10103725248908121_5212577054778948183_o.jpg","digest":"pqsiRQ6r/z1KOHVK4O81nQ==\n"}

Officer Mario Figueroa took part in the May 3 arrest of car theft suspect David Vladim Suazo.\n\nThe 51-second video posted Thursday morning by a witness, Lisa Harrell, shows the 31-year-old suspect lying face down on the ground with an officer standing over him. That officer gets on his back and handcuffs him. Suazo doesn't appear to be struggling.\n\nJust after the second handcuff is secured, an officer identified as Figueroa runs in and kicks Suazo in the head. That officer then turns around and dives on Suazo's head.\n\nFigueroa has been charged with one count of assault, a second-degree misdemeanor, the station reports. An arraignment date has not yet been set.\n\nHarrell, a stay-at-home mom, says she went outside her apartment Thursday morning to see what was causing her dog to bark.

Instead, it revived accusations that Mrs. Trump’s ideas were really coming from somewhere else.\n\nObservers on Twitter quickly pointed out that one of the primary materials with “Be Best” branding, a booklet on social media guidelines called “Talking With Kids About Being Online,” had been circulated by the Federal Trade Commission during the Obama era. As the story spread, Mrs. Trump’s communications director published an extraordinary statement on Tuesday that admonished the news media for reporting on the plagiarism claims.\n\n“Our office will continue to focus on helping children, and I encourage members of the media to attempt to Be Best in their own professions,” the communications director, Stephanie Grisham, wrote, “and focus on some of the children and programs Mrs. Trump highlighted in her remarks yesterday.”\n\nBefore the official “Be Best” rollout on Monday, aides had been upfront to reporters when asked about the fact that Mrs. Trump’s office was repackaging items, including the Federal Trade Commission booklet, from other programs. Among program materials distributed to reporters covering the event was an initiative by the National Safety Council intended to encourage people to talk to their doctors about opioid abuse.\n\nMrs. Trump’s staff plans to continue to solicit ideas for the initiative, which focuses on opioid abuse, social media pressures and mental health issues among young people, from places the first lady has visited. Those include a West Virginia clinic that treats infants born with opioid addiction and a Michigan school where students participate in a program to stress the importance of emotional intelligence and kindness.","author":"Katie Rogers","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T19:37:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-new-york-times","name":"The New York Times"},"urlToImage":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/us/politics/09dc-melania/09dc-melania-facebookJumbo.jpg","digest":"IPSfb4aVoPzdB4thxOg09Q==\n"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5af21a4b6f647d6be529cc44"},"description":"Google’s I/O 2018 keynote had a bunch of major announcements about Android P, Google Assistant, and more. Here’s the most important news to know.","title":"The 10 biggest announcements from Google I/O 2018","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17328828/google-io-keynote-summary-highlights-news-recap-2018","text":"Google just wrapped up its 2018 I/O keynote, and today’s event was jam-packed with news. CEO Sundar Pichai kicked things off by recognizing that the tech industry must always be responsible about the tools and services it creates. From there, the big announcements started and just kept coming. We’ve got a new, ambitious Android update on the way. John Legend is lending his voice to Google Assistant. Gmail can almost write emails entirely by itself. AI was a big theme throughout.\n\nGoodbye, three-button navigation. Hello, digital wellbeing Dashboard. Android P shakes up a lot of what we’ve come to know about Google’s mobile OS. It’s got a refreshed look. Key interactions like changing apps are now accomplished through iPhone X-like gestures. And there’s a new Dashboard that’s meant to plainly show “how you’re spending time on your device, including time spent in apps, how many times you’ve unlocked your phone, and how many notifications you’ve received.” You can even set time limits for individual apps if you want to cut back on compulsively staring at your phone at any moment of downtime.\n\nAndroid P is coming later this summer, but a public beta is available today for a handful of smartphones from Google, Essential, Sony, Nokia, and more.\n\nGoogle’s virtual assistant is getting some more voice variety. Users will get to pick from six additional, natural sounding voices in addition to the original one you’re probably familiar with. Google calls that original voice “Holly.” Oh, and a John Legend voice is also coming to Assistant later this year. Seriously.\n\nPerhaps the most jaw-dropping moment of today’s keynote came when Sundar Pichai played back a recording of Google Assistant calling a hair salon and making an appointment in a conversation that legitimately sounded like two humans talking to each other. There was no hint of a robotic voice or that the salon employee recognized they were talking to AI.\n\nAmazon’s Echo Show is about to face some competition from similar devices running Google’s software. Google announced that the first Smart Displays with Assistant built in will begin shipping in July. A demonstration on stage showed the display pulling up Jimmy Kimmel Live on YouTube TV as just one example of content that Google offers that Amazon can’t — you know, since the companies still hate each other.\n\nGoogle is expanding on its helpful Smart Reply feature with a more ambitious idea: Smart Compose. Smart Compose uses AI “to help you draft emails from scratch, faster.” Does having Gmail create emails without your involvement sound scary? Don’t worry, as the company isn’t going quite that far (yet). Instead, the new feature will make suggestions for complete sentences as you’re typing. Smart Compose is coming to the new Gmail for consumers first over the next few weeks; G Suite users will have to wait a few months.\n\nMaps is growing into a full-on social experience that’s squarely targeting Yelp and Foursquare. A new For You tab lets you follow specific neighborhoods to see new restaurants and business that are trending among other users. And you can even coordinate with friends in real time to make a “shortlist” when choosing a place to eat at.\n\nIs this Google Maps as it was always meant to be? I think so. If it works accurately and reliably, this will be a huge help for people navigating a new city. Point your camera in a direction, and Google will pair AI with Street View data to give you an interactive, AR turn-by-turn experience when you’re on the move. There’s even a cute little fox to help keep you on course.\n\nGoogle Photos is gaining new features like the ability to separate subjects from the background in photos and pop the color or turn the background black and white. Photos can also now colorize your older photos — even if they weren’t shot in color to begin with. Both of these capabilities use AI. And when you’re just swiping through your gallery, Photos will analyze your pics and make recommendations for quick fixes like “fix brightness.”\n\nGoogle’s news app is being overhauled and its editorial focus is now powered largely by AI. The company says “it uses artificial intelligence to analyze all the content published to the web at any moment, and organize all of those articles, videos, and more into storylines. It spots the ones you might be interested in and puts them in your briefing.” News will also deliver “a range of perspectives” to bring you a little bit outside your bubble.\n\nThis is something Google has demonstrated before, but now it sounds like the feature is ready and actually coming to Google Lens. You’ll be able to point your phone’s camera at text in the real world — say, a written down Wi-Fi password — grab that text, and then paste it into a text field on your smartphone.\n\nAnd now it’s also going to help you buy fashionable things. Google Lens still isn’t perfect at identifying precise items of clothing, but Google thinks it can get close enough. The company is introducing a new “style match” feature that will scan something the camera is pointed at and help you buy it from internet retailers. Sounds like a dream come true for Pinterest fans. But will Amazon be among those stores?","author":"Chris Welch","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T19:13:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-verge","name":"The Verge"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kgr_Bku3OWkaUeth73d1guKdgOU=/0x267:2362x1504/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10801317/Screen_Shot_2018_05_08_at_1.19.10_PM.png","digest":"eRMHgFjil2Sjx1k9M1lZeg==\n"}

Two people with knowledge of the trip told The Washington Post that Pompeo was expected to bring them home.\n\n“We’ll all soon be finding out,” Trump replied after a reporter asked him about the prisoners.\n\nThree Korean Americans — Kim Dong-chul, Kim Hak-song and Tony Kim — have been accused of various acts considered hostile to the government. Trump and his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have dropped hints recently that they could be freed soon.\n\n“A lot of good things have already happened with respect to the hostages,” Trump said at the White House on Friday. “And I think you’re going to see very good things.”\n\nOne of the prisoners, Kim Dong-chul, a former Virginia resident in his mid-60s, was detained in October 2015, while the other two were detained after Trump took office.\n\nIn an interview with two reporters traveling with him aboard his plane, Pompeo said he plans to raise again the U.S. desire that the three men be freed, adding, “I’d be a great gesture if they’d agree to do so.”\n\nThe main purpose of Pompeo’s visit to North Korea is to finalize an exact time and location for the summit between Trump and the North Korean leader, how long their talks will last and to clarify expectations.\n\n“We also want to make sure what our expectations are not,” Pompeo said. “We are not going to head down the path we headed down before. We will not relieve sanctions until such time as we have achieved our objectives. We’re not going to do this in small increments, where the world is coerced into relieving economic pressures.”\n\nPompeo left Washington from Joint Base Andrews late Monday on a trip that was not announced by the State Department. He was accompanied by several other senior officials, including Brian Hook, head of State’s policy planning division, and Matthew Pottinger, the senior Asia director at the National Security Council.\n\nIn his second visit to North Korea in as many months, and his first as secretary of state, Pompeo is flying into one of the world’s most reclusive countries with no assurances of exactly who he will meet. During his last visit over Easter, when he was CIA director, Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in an effort to assess what a summit might accomplish.\n\nJust before he landed in Japan for refueling, Pompeo said he doesn’t know exactly who he will see this time. “We’re prepared to meet anyone who can speak on behalf of the North Korean government and give us solid answers so we’re prepared.”\n\nPompeo’s return to North Korea comes in what it only his second week as the administration’s top diplomat. Arrangements were made in great secrecy befitting a former CIA head. Pompeo has promised to “bring back the swagger” to a State Department that has been sidelined in some foreign policy debates. His high-profile visit appears to be a splashy step in that direction.\n\nPompeo may get an earful of complaints from the officials he meets. Pyongyang has been disgruntled over what it called “misleading” assertions from some U.S. officials that North Korea is considering denuclearization because of its fear of U.S. military prowess and to alleviate punishing sanctions — a “maximum pressure campaign” laid by Pompeo’s predecessor, Rex Tillerson, who was fired by Trump in March.\n\nNorth Korea made its displeasure clear Sunday, the day before Pompeo departed Washington. A spokesman for its foreign ministry labeled the U.S. claims of credit for the apparent shift in North Korean policy a “dangerous attempt” to upset detente between two nations whose leaders only a few months ago were threatening nuclear war.\n\nU.S. officials have sought to tamp down expectations that Pompeo will be able to secure the release of the prisoners who were recently transferred from a labor camp to a hotel outside Pyongyang, further raising hopes their release is imminent\n\nNow, with a high-level summit only weeks away, U.S. officials have increasingly urged North Korea to release the three American prisoners in advance.\n\nLast weekend, national security adviser John Bolton told Fox News Sunday, “If North Korea releases the detained Americans before the North-U. S. summit, it will be an opportunity to demonstrate their authenticity.”\n\nThe end of their incarceration in a country known for its brutality to prisoners would close a long chapter in hostilities between the United States and North Korea, a period during which U.S. officials accused Pyongyang of using American citizens as bargaining chips.\n\nAt least 16 U.S. citizens have been arrested in North Korea since the 1990s. Several of them have been subjected to show trials and forced to make public confessions to crimes against the state. Most served part of their sentences before being released, usually after visits from high-profile Americans such as former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.\n\nLast summer, North Korea turned over custody of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier, who returned home to Cincinnati in a coma after 17 months in captivity after being detained during an organized tour of Pyongyang. Warmbier died a few days later, and Trump has highlighted his death in several major speeches, including the State of the Union address in January and remarks to the South Korean general assembly last fall.\n\nWarmbier’s parents have sued North Korea in federal court, charging that the regime “brutally tortured and murdered” their son. Trump spoke with the family on Friday to offer support ahead of his summit, sources said.","author":"https://www.facebook.com/nakamuradavid","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T18:47:50.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eXmxzvTR0r6VzTis99REGx5ProY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/55ACPCSS5MI6RJKRLNSIVPRJ54.jpg","digest":"wRn6byX3b3GSl0RFiKfTjQ==\n"}

He called it “a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” and he asserted that Iran harbors ambitions to build nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump said he would begin reinstating “powerful” U.S. nuclear-related sanctions against Iran. But he offered no specifics on the sanctions to be reimposed.\n\nThe decision could trigger renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil sales and Central Bank, potentially disrupting Iran's global financial transactions and putting further pressure on its already volatile economy. It also could put European allies in a bind over whether to continue the economic dealmaking they launched with Iran since the accord was implemented in early 2016. The allies have stood firmly behind the accord, which was negotiated between Iran and six world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany.\n\nThe allies could also suffer penalties under renewed U.S. sanctions, removing incentives to continue to invest in Iran.\n\nIn his speech, Trump also accused Iran of destabilizing the Middle East through its support of militant groups such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and he charged that Tehran seeks to build “nuclear-capable” ballistic missiles.\n\n“If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,” Trump asserted. “We cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” he added. “The Iran deal is defective at its core.”\n\nAs part of the nuclear deal, Iran pledged never to “seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.” Iran’s supreme religious and political leader has declared nuclear weapons to be un-Islamic, saying that its nuclear program is aimed solely at producing energy and conducting medical research.\n\nIranian leaders said Tuesday that the country would stand united in the face of any new sanctions or threats from the United States.\n\nIran “could face some problems” if Trump restores sanctions, Rouhani said at a petroleum conference in the capital, Tehran, before Trump announced his decision. “But we will move on.”\n\n“If we are under sanctions or not, we should stand on our feet,” the Reuters news agency quoted him as saying.\n\nRouhani's first vice president, Eshaq Jahangiri, said the government has “a plan for managing the country under any circumstances.”\n\nIn remarks reported by Iran's Tasnim News Agency, Jahangiri, a popular reformist, said it would be “naive” to enter into negotiations with the United States again.\n\nThe comments underscored a growing debate among political factions in Iran over what to do ifafter the U.S. withdrawal. Some politicians have urged the government to continue to work with Europe to salvage the accord, which lifted key international sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.\n\n“If the Europeans are willing to give us sufficient guarantees, it makes sense for us to stay in the deal,” the deputy speaker of Iran's parliament, Ali Motahari, said in remarks carried by theIranian Students' News Agency.\n\nMotahari said Iran should wait several months to see whether Europe plans to resist U.S. pressure to disengage from the Iranian economy, where European companies have invested in sectors ranging from auto manufacturing to oil exploration and tourism.\n\nIf Europe succeeds, “this is a victory for Iran, because it will have created a gap between the United States and Europe,” he said.\n\nBut others have been less forgiving, urging Iran's leaders to immediately withdraw and restart suspended elements of the country's nuclear program if the United States left the deal. Fliers circulating online called for a rally in Iran's northeastern city of Mashhad to “set the JCPOA on fire.” The nuclear deal is also known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nThe Iranian parliament’s Nuclear Committee published three actions that the government could take if Trump leaves the deal, including installing more centrifuges and enriching uranium beyond the levels allowed under the accord. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power plants or — if enriched at much higher levels — as fissile material for nuclear weapons.\n\nIf Trump confronts Iran, “we will not remain passive,” the head of the National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, said Tuesday in an interview with the Hamshahri newspaper.\n\nHe said Europe made a mistake when its leaders appeased Trump by attempting to extract further concessions from Iran, including a potential halt to its ballistic missile program. The nuclear deal was the result of painstaking negotiations over two years between the Rouhani administration and the world powers, including the Obama administration\n\nWhile Iran accepted severe limits to its nuclear program, including inspections, critics said the deal failed to address other problematic aspects of Iranian policy, including its missile development and support for militant groups in Iraq and Syria.\n\n“The Islamic Republic will stand firmly against this threat,” Shamkhani said of the Trump administration's stance.\n\nEven as Iranian leaders vowed to weather the storm, Iran's economy was already feeling the strain. Iran’s Central Bank governor, Valiollah Seif, downplayed any potential shock to Iranian markets, which have been roiled by high inflation and a collapsing currency.\n\n“We are prepared for all scenarios,” Seif said on state television. “If America pulls out of the deal, our economy will not be impacted.”\n\nButthe Iranian rial was trading Tuesday at near record lows against the dollar, as Iranians looked to buy hard currency ahead of Trump’s announcement, economists said.\n\nAccording to Pratibha Thaker, an Iran expert at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a risk analysis group, Trump's withdrawal from the pact would accelerate regional insecurity, cause a dip in global oil supplies and plunge the Iranian economy into recession.\n\n“Anxiety, stress . . . [these are] people's feelings just hours before Mr. Trump's extraordinary decision,” an Iranian journalist, Amine Sherifkan, posted on Twitter.\n\nWorsening economic woes could spell trouble for Rouhani, a moderate cleric who championed the nuclear deal as a way to jump-start Iran’s economy and end the country’s isolation.\n\nRouhani staked much of his political credibility on the nuclear deal with world powers. But even as oil exports picked up in the wake of the agreement, ordinary Iranians have said they felt few tangible benefits from the accord.\n\nWidespread economic unrest, currency fluctuations and a recent judicial ban on the popular messaging app, Telegram, have all weakened the president, analysts said. A collapse of the nuclear pact could weaken Rouhani further, giving room for hard-line opponents of the accord to exert more influence.\n\n“Rouhani is already under huge pressure,” said Saeid Hasanzadeh, an Iranian analyst based in Istanbul.\n\nHe said that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate religious and political authority in Iran, has distanced himself enough from the nuclear deal that its failure would be blamed on Rouhani.\n\nThe supreme leader “did not take direct responsibility for the deal,” Hasanzadeh said. “So the responsibility falls entirely on Rouhani's shoulders.”\n\nBijan Sabbagh in Istanbul and William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news","author":"https://www.facebook.com/erinmichellecunningham","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T18:38:09.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dPMdOgoJL2BwXN1NW2Jx1nQobDE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RBT72CSYMI6RK6YEZN5A6UYLE.jpg","digest":"JabVTt+wVgKbqiBWbQZPmQ==\n"}

The report struck a chord with the President, who was bothered by the development and has grown more open to his aides' arguments that Pruitt must go, a White House aide and source close to the White House said.\n\nDespite nearly a dozen investigations into Pruitt's conduct, Trump has resisted calls to fire Pruitt, worried about disruptions to his deregulatory agenda and concerned that it would be difficult to confirm a successor. White House aides have assured the President the agency's work can continue unabated if the EPA's recently-confirmed deputy administrator, Andrew Wheeler, takes over.\n\n\"The ground has absolutely shifted,\" said a source close to the White House, who said the President is becoming convinced that Pruitt is doing more harm than good in his position.\n\nBut it was the allegation that Pruitt's team was taking aim at Zinke in an effort to distract from the EPA administrator's ethical troubles that has especially troubled the President and his aides, who were angry after catching wind of the reported plot, one White House source said.\n\n\"A line was crossed,\" said the source, who said Trump was made aware of the story after it broke on Friday, said.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House and EPA didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nA senior administration official said White House aides looked into the possibility of firing Michael Abboud, the Pruitt aide accused of shopping the stories, after the report of his behavior first surfaced. But aides in the personnel office discovered Abboud was outside of the White House's jurisdiction and could only be removed by Pruitt, the senior administration official said.\n\nAbboud did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor weeks, White House chief of staff John Kelly and other senior White House aides have urged Pruitt's firing. But in a significant development, two sources said Pruitt is also losing the support of one of his most loyal West Wing defenders, the White House legislative director Marc Short.\n\n\"I think he's finding it tougher and tougher to defend all these allegations,\" one White House official said.\n\nShort, who is tasked with shepherding nominees on Capitol Hill, denied that he is wavering on Pruitt, telling CNN: \"I remain supportive of Scott.\"\n\nWhat's clear is that White House aides are leading a new push to convince the President to abandon his EPA administrator.\n\nAnother White House official noted efforts to turn Trump against his EPA administrator have persisted for weeks as allegations against Pruitt have piled up and spawned multiple investigations into his conduct.\n\n\"The push isn't new. Some people here wanted him out a month ago,\" the aide said. \"I think they see an opportunity with the Atlantic piece to make their case.\"\n\n\"I think there's a push to force (Trump's) hand,\" the White House aide added.\n\nUntil recently, discussions with Trump about firing Pruitt gained little traction, in part because Trump continues to appreciate the deregulatory work his EPA administrator has performed.\n\nMultiple White House officials are pointing to their struggle to shepherd a series of candidates through the confirmation process as the main thing keeping Pruitt in his job.\n\nPruitt faces a growing list of scandals that would easily sink a high ranking official in most administrations. Reports ranging from his lavish travel accommodations to conflicting explanations for why his aides received significant pay raises without White House approval have created a series of headaches for an administration beset by controversy.\n\nMaking matter worse: The trouble for Pruitt is piling up as the White House tries to recover from its failed nomination of Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Meanwhile, Trump's pick for CIA director, Gina Haspel, is facing a potentially tough battle in the Senate as she prepares for her Wednesday confirmation hearing.\n\nIn an ironic way, those challenges have helped Pruitt. A senior administration official noted that even Mike Pompeo, who was previously confirmed by the Senate to run the CIA, faced headwinds in his recent confirmation vote to become secretary of state. A new EPA chief, the official noted, could face even stronger resistance in a narrowly divided Senate.\n\nDespite the seemingly shifting tides, no one would predict whether Pruitt's departure is imminent.\n\n\"No clue with Trump,\" said one source close to the White House. \"It could happen today, next week, never,\" the source said.","author":"Sarah Westwood, Jeremy Diamond and Pamela Brown, CNN","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T17:11:00.000Z"},"source":{"id":"cnn","name":"CNN"},"urlToImage":"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180502131334-04-pruitt-04-26-2018-super-tease.jpg","digest":"4ZzUSpiq/RQ3rXwmxJUGnA==\n"}

I don't care if they don't have mine, but that's disgraceful.\"\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported that Giuliani has fallen out of favor with Trump following a nearly weeklong media blitz. Citing four sources familiar with the president's thinking, CNN said Trump \"has been flustered by the onslaught of negative coverage generated\" by Giuliani.\n\n\"Trump has grown irritated by Giuliani's performances and the headaches he has caused as contradictory statements between the two flash across the chyrons on his screen,\" CNN reported.\n\nTrump was reportedly irritated by Giuliani's Sunday interview with ABC's \"This Week,\" during which the lawyer left the door open to the idea that Trump had been involved in more payoffs to women aside from the $130,000 hush-money payment to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Daniels says she had an affair with the president in 2006, something the White House has denied.\n\nCNN reported that Trump was particularly irked by Giuliani's refusal to rule out that Trump would plead the Fifth in the special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Giuliani said on Tuesday that Trump had told his legal team he did not want to do that.\n\nGiuliani's media tear began last week when he told the Fox News host Sean Hannity that Trump reimbursed his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels in October 2016. Cohen had previously said Trump did not reimburse him, and Trump had denied knowing about the payment.\n\nAfter his interview with Hannity, Giuliani said his revelation about the reimbursement was made with Trump's approval.\n\nGiuliani suggested during an interview on \"Fox \u0026 Friends\" on Thursday morning that such an allegation being made public would have been politically damaging to Trump. But he later told NBC News that the payment had nothing to do with the campaign and was instead meant to \"prevent personal embarrassment and heartache to his wife,\" first lady Melania Trump.\n\nGiuliani released a statement Friday saying there was \"no campaign violation\" because the payment was not made for a campaign purpose but to protect Trump's family.\n\nThe onslaught of commentary led Trump to tell reporters on Friday that Giuliani would \"get his facts straight\" on the payment. The president called Giuliani a \"great guy\" who \"really has his heart in\" handling Trump's legal work, adding that the former US attorney was just \"learning the subject matter.\"","author":"Allan Smith","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T15:33:35.000Z"},"source":{"id":"business-insider","name":"Business Insider"},"urlToImage":"https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af1ba65075e8d1b008b4577-640-320.jpg","digest":"E58WLZh3OLqWZuu4/DcHoQ==\n"}

The state has the nation’s highest rate of opioid overdose death; the epidemic now claims tens of thousands of lives each year.\n\n“With the benefit of hindsight, I wish we had moved faster and asked a different set of questions,” Barrett said. “I am deeply sorry we did not. Today, I am confident we would reach different conclusions about those two pharmacies.”\n\nFive drug distribution executives were summoned to testify before a House Energy and Commerce Committee oversight panel Tuesday, and though Barrett said he wished he had identified the problem sooner, he stopped short of accepting responsibility for the epidemic. When Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), chairman of the panel, asked the executives whether they believe the conduct of their companies contributed to the widespread opioid problem, he and three others denied it.\n\n[Drug executives to testify before Congress about their role in U.S. opioid crisis]\n\n“No,” Barrett said, joining all others except Joseph Mastandrea, chairman of the board at Miami-Luken, who replied: “Yes.”\n\nThe dramatic testimony came before a subcommittee that has spent a year investigating pill dumping in West Virginia by wholesale drug distributors, which are required by law to submit suspicious drug orders to the Drug Enforcement Administration. If orders and sales are not correctly reported, it can ease the diversion of drugs to the black market, where they are often sold at a premium, fueling addiction.\n\nIn addition to Cardinal and Miami-Luken, executives from AmerisourceBergen, McKesson Corp., and H.D. Smith testified for nearly three hours.\n\nThe panel revealed in letters sent in February that McKesson and Cardinal Health shipped 12.3 million doses of powerful prescription opioids to the Family Discount Pharmacy in Mount Gay-Shamrock, W.Va., from 2006 to 2014. The panel also is looking into deliveries Cardinal made to the Hurley Drug Company in Williamson, W.Va., which received more than 10.5 million pills during that same time period. A single pharmacy in Kermit, W. Va., a town of about 400 people, received nearly 9 million hydrocodone pills during two years.\n\nCardinal said it has not distributed hydrocodone or oxycodone to the pharmacy in Mt. Gay-Shamrock since 2012 and has not sent the drugs to Williamson since 2014.\n\n“I am so frustrated for the people in West Virginia and across this country that you all have not ... stepped up and took more responsibility for this,” said Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W. Va.). “The fury inside me right now is bubbling over.”\n\n[One small town, two drug companies and 12.3 million doses of opioids]\n\nThe hearing room was packed with attorneys, lobbyists and staffers for the drug companies alongside lawyers for counties, towns and cities that are suing the companies — a massive case that has been consolidated in Cleveland, with many of the distributors as defendants. Municipalities are seeking damages to help them pay for the cost of opioid addiction, which has decimated budgets and strained resources. All but one of the executives said they have personally met with people affected by opioid addiction.\n\nJohn M. Gray, CEO of The Healthcare Distribution Alliance, a trade group that represents distributors, said in a statement that the companies understand the “tragic impact” of opioid abuse, but “we need to be realistic and acknowledge that this epidemic was not caused by distributors who neither prescribe, manufacture, nor dispense medicines.” He said the root of the problem lies in “decades of belief that opioids could be prescribed with little risk.”\n\nThe executives pinned a good deal of blame on doctors, who they said overprescribed painkillers, and on the licensed pharmacists who dispensed them.\n\n“I want to know whether you all should be held to account, because if the doctors and the pharmacies are being held responsible, I sure as the dickens think you all have a role in this thing too,” McKinley said.\n\nMcKinley asked John Hammergren, the chairman, president and CEO of McKesson Corporation, if he regrets his company’s role in the crisis.\n\n“I don’t know how you can look at this crisis and not feel terrible about what is going on in this country,” Hammergren said.\n\nHammergren said his company distributed about 151 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone in West Virginia between 2007 and 2012, a fraction of the nearly 2 billion doses of all prescription medicines McKesson distributed in the state during that time frame.\n\n“Put another way, West Virginia pharmacies overall were, and continue to be, very high-volume customers for prescription drugs generally,” he said.\n\nSome members said they still could not understand why so many painkillers were distributed in such places. “The sheer number of opioids dumped into small towns,” said Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), “ is just baffling and simply incomprehensible.”\n\n[The drug industry’s triumph over the DEA]\n\nCardinal Health was fined $44 million in 2016 to resolve allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of narcotics. In 2008, Cardinal paid a $34 million fine to settle similar allegations.\n\nRep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) asked Hammergren why McKesson kept shipping massive quantities of opioids to small towns despite having agreed to the terms of the settlements.\n\n“You saw paying the penalties on the settlement agreements was a cost worth paying because you were making so much money?” she asked. Hammergren replied: “Any settlement with a regulator, we take very seriously.”He was also asked how much the company makes from two drugs that are used to reverse opioid overdoses and have seen steep price increases in recent years. Hammergren said he does not know.\n\nMcKinley wondered what the punishment should be for helping create a crisis that kills 900 people in West Virginia each year: “I just want you to feel shame about your roles, respectively, in all of this.”","author":"https://www.facebook.com/zezimak, https://www.facebook.com/highamsj","publishedAt":{"$date":"2018-05-08T15:09:01.000Z"},"source":{"id":"the-washington-post","name":"The Washington Post"},"urlToImage":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HtdKtRbVhjRxNi7E9mlP9OobguY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHWX2BSSRAI6RHERPWVVS3UCKI.jpg","digest":"oPvoqKA0bIPo7NmYenl5Pw==\n"}
